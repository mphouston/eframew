### Java A Support Library

This provides some utilities for Java 8 applications for use with external tools
such as the report engine. These classes are not full-featured implementations, but are 
used as stubs in the Java-8 only clients.  The classes are replaced on the production server 
by the real classes.  

See [Designer Studio Setup](https://simplemes.github.io/simplemes-core/eframe/guide.html#designer-studio-setup)
for details on how to use this library.

See the [documentation](https://simplemes.github.io/simplemes-core/) for all documents.

Build instructions:

* cd java8-supp
* ./gradlew build

Load the library as an external JAR file in the 
[Designer Studio](https://simplemes.github.io/simplemes-core/eframe/guide.html#designer-studio-setup).
