=== Reports


The third-party report engine is provided by the open-source
https://community.jaspersoft.com/[Jasper Reports^] library.  This report engine can
generate reports from user-designed reports created in an interactive report designer.
You can produce custom reports using this designer.
See link:{eframe-path}/guide.html#report-engine[Report Engine^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]
for more details on add-on reports.

This MES core module uses the report engine to produce a number reports on the shop
floor activity. These reports are hyper-linked with drill-downs and other links to
related reports as shown below:
