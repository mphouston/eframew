This dashboard provides easy access to the common tasks that a shop floor operator
will need. It provide ways to work on orders/LSNs, setup resources and to view
status of the operator's area. This dashboard is configurable.  You can decide
which actions an operator can execute and how the page looks.

This section will describe the dashboard events and how multiple activities are designed
to work together.
We will also describe the activities (sub-pages) available to display when a
user presses the button and the available default activities for the dashboard.

Most of the communication between activities is done via the provided parameters mechanism.
Key values from the input fields are passed to all activities as they are triggered.
For example, the <<Work Center Selection>> provides the current work center and the
value from the order/LSN input field when an activity is triggered by a button.

==== Dashboard Events

A typical dashboard has a number of dashboard activities displayed at a given time.
Your application may need to coordinate behavior between these activities.
For example, a selection list may need to inform another activity that the user changed
the selection. <<reference.adoc#dashboard-event-reference,Dashboard Events>> are used
to allow your activities to communicate these type of changes.

The important events are:

* <<reference.adoc#order_lsn_changed,ORDER_LSN_CHANGED>>
//* <<reference.adoc#work_center_changed,WORK_CENTER_CHANGED>>
* <<reference.adoc#work_list_selected,WORK_LIST_SELECTED>>


[[dashboard-complete-activity]]
==== Complete Activity

*uri:* `/work/completeActivity`

This <<reference.adoc#dashboard-complete-activity,Complete>> activity is a
link:{eframe-path}/guide.html#dashboard-activity-non-gui[Non-GUI Activity^]
icon:share-square[role="link-blue"].
This means it normally does not display a GUI and just performs the complete action.
This activity works with the
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/mes/demand/controller/WorkController.html[WorkController^]
icon:share-square[role="link-blue"]
`complete()` method to perform the action.

The complete activity uses the Order/LSN parameter from the <<Work Center Selection>>
activity and attempts to complete the work on it.  Any errors are displayed in the dashboard's message area.


[[dashboard-start-activity]]
==== Start Activity

*uri:* `/work/startActivity`

This <<reference.adoc#dashboard-start-activity,Start>> activity is a
link:{eframe-path}/guide.html#dashboard-activity-non-gui[Non-GUI Activity^]
icon:share-square[role="link-blue"].
This means it normally does not display a GUI and just performs the start action.
This activity works with the
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/mes/demand/controller/WorkController.html[WorkController^]
icon:share-square[role="link-blue"]
`start()` method to perform the action.

The start activity uses the Order/LSN parameter from the <<Work Center Selection>> activity and attempts to
start the work on it.  Any errors are displayed in the dashboard's message area.

[[dashboard-reverse-start-activity]]
==== Reverse Start Activity

*uri:* `/work/reverseStartActivity`

This
link:reference.html#dashboard-reverse-start-activity[Reverse Start^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]
activity is a
link:{eframe-path}/guide.html#dashboard-activity-non-gui[Non-GUI Activity^] icon:share-square[role="link-blue"].
This means it normally does not display a GUI and just performs the reverse start action.
This activity works with the
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/mes/demand/controller/WorkController.html[WorkController^]
icon:share-square[role="link-blue"] `reverseStart()` method to perform the action.

The reverse start activity uses the Order/LSN parameter from the <<Work Center Selection>>
activity and attempts to reverse the start on it.  Any errors are displayed in the
dashboard's message area.

[[dashboard-reverse-complete-activity]]
==== Reverse Complete Activity

*uri:* `/work/reverseCompleteActivity`

This
link:reference.html#dashboard-reverse-complete-activity[Reverse Complete^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]
activity is a
link:{eframe-path}/guide.html#dashboard-activity-non-gui[Non-GUI Activity^] icon:share-square[role="link-blue"].
This means it normally does not display a GUI and just performs the reverse complete action.
This activity works with the
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/mes/demand/controller/WorkController.html[WorkController^]
icon:share-square[role="link-blue"] `reverseComplete()` method to perform the action.

The reverse complete activity uses the Order/LSN parameter from the <<Work Center Selection>>
activity and attempts to reverse the complete on it.  Any errors are displayed in the
dashboard's message area.

This reverse action will mark the Order/LSN as not done and issue a negative <<ProductionLog>>
record.  This action also places the Qty back in queue.  It does not perform a start on the
qty.

[[dashboard-work-center-selection]]
==== Work Center Selection

*uri:* `/selection/workCenterSelection`

This <<reference.adoc#dashboard-work-center-selection,Work Center Selection>> activity
is designed to be used in the primary section (top) of the dashboard and will allow the
operators to select the work center they are working in and enter an order or LSN to
process.  The buttons that can be added to this activity will let the operator perform
common actions on the entered work center, order or LSN.

In this dashboard activity, the operator can change the work center by clicking on the work center. This
will open a dialog that lets the operator select the work center they are working in.  This work center
is retained and used as the default the next time the user uses this dashboard.


[[dashboard-work-list]]
==== Work List

*uri:* `/workList/workListActivity`

This link:reference.html#dashboard-work-list[Work List^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] activity
is used to display active or queued work for the operator.
The current Work Center (<<Work Center Selection>>) is used to filter this work to
manageable level, but it is not required.

As the operator selects entries, the current selection is coordinated with the
selection activity to keep the actions in synch.
