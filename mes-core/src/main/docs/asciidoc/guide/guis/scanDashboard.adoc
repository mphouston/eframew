This dashboard is different from most of the dashboards provided with SimpleMES.
It is designed to work with a very specific flow that is streamlined for barcode
scanner use. Many different <<Barcode Formats>> are supported.

See the <<ScanService>> for more overview on the scanning process and how modules work.

This dashboard detects barcode scans and uses simple logic to process those scans.
For example, if an Order is scanned that is in queue, then the Order is started.
That order is then used for later actions.

NOTE: This flow assumes the barcode scanner sends a TAB character after the scan
      and sends the scanned values through the browser as if typed from the keyboard.

The basic flow is as follows:

. The user scans an order.
. If the order is in queue, then the dashboard starts the order.
. The order is now the 'current' order.
. The user scans a component product (part number).
. The dashboard selects the component in the UI.
. The user scans the component lot.
. The dashboard uses that lot to assemble the component into the order.
. The user scans the barcode for the complete action.
. The dashboard completes the order and is ready to start again.

The component steps are supported with the
link:{mes-assy-path}/guide.html[Assembly^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] module.


This is a very opinionated approach to shop floor operator GUIs.  It may not work with
all of your scenarios, but it will streamline your operations a lot.  Some adjustments
to the flow are supported, but you can create your own logic as needed in customizations.


=== Manual Actions - Scan Dashboard

Sometimes a barcode is missing or can't be scanned. In this case, the operator can
just type the value, followed by a TAB key.  This value will be display on the screen
as they type.  Backspace is the only edit key supported.

Also, if the keyboard focus is in an input field, then the scanned value is entered into the field and
processed for that field only.  This allows for some scenarios that require minor user input in the GUI.
For example, selecting the component when a component barcode is not available (Assembly module only).


=== Scan Dashboard - provideScanParameters

Most scan dashboard configurations will implement the concept of a current order or LSN.
The user will scan the order/LSN and that will initiate some action (e.g. Start).  This will also
make it the current order/LSN.

Later scans will need this order/LSN for proper processing (e.g. for component assembly).
To make this work, the scan dashboard Javascript library will call the
`provideScanParameters()` method in all current activities.  This lets the scan activity
provide the current order/LSN for the scan request.
