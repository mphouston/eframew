=== Dashboards

SimpleMES provides a number of user-level GUIs to help your users define, operate and
monitor your shop floor.   This includes setup GUIs, operator GUIs and reports.

These dashboards are designed for operators to use on the shop floor.
These provide the most common actions available to the operators.
The dashboards are based on the framework
link:{eframe-path}/guide.html#dashboards[Dashboards^] icon:share-square[role="link-blue"] .

Most dashboards can be configured by the end user.  The dashboards can use many
different activities, but not all activities will work together cleanly.
The activities are described in detail in the
<<reference.adoc#dashboards,Dashboard Reference>>.
