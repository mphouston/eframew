=== WorkCenter

A link:reference.html#workcenter[WorkCenter^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]
is a machine or location where a manufacturing operation is performed.
It can also refer to the people at a location where the operation is performed.

The core work center domain class is fairly simple with just the normal fields (e.g. title)
and a basic overall status.

Some examples include:

* CELL27
* BENCH43
* TESTER
* ASSEMBLY CELL 12
* FINAL PACKAGING AREA

For detailed field information, see the API Documentation at:

Additional functionality for the work center to perform assembly is covered in the module
