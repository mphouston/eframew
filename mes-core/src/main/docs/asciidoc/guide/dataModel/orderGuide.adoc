An link:reference.html#order[Order^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]
is a manufacturing order used to produce an (optional) <<Product>>.  These orders
specify the quantity needed and optionally a due date, start date and other information.
Orders may use the standard <<Routing>> or may have an order-specific Routing.

Orders can be created in SimpleMES or they may be imported from an ERP system.

Orders have several statuses that indicate the state of many aspects of the order.  The overall
status controls the overall availability of the order.  It indicates if the order has been released
for production, is on hold for some reason or if the order is done.

Orders must be released in order to work them on the shop floor.  This done through the GUI or by
using the <<OrderService>>.
The release process moves the quantity to in queue at the appropriate place.  If there is a routing,
then this quantity is queued at the first operation.  If there are LSNs defined, then the quantity
is released to an LSN as needed.  This depends on the product's lot size and LSN tracking option.

Orders are considered to be 'Lots' in many cases.  For serialized tracking or small lot tracking,
<<lsn,LSNs>> can be used as optional elements of an order.

Processing of the orders (or LSNs) for actual production is done using the
<<WorkService>>. This allows you to perform work at specific operations on the
routing and track what happened to the order/LSN on the shop floor.
