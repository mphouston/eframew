=== ActionLog

The link:reference.html#actionlog[ActionLog^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]
class represents a single action by a user on the shop floor.
Typically, this is written when an order/LSN acted on in any way.

These records are designed to exist as long as the owning objects (e.g. Order) are in the database.
The records are archived when the owning objects are archived.  This is something the <<Order>> object
handles with its `findRelatedRecords()` method to find the ActionLog records.

For detailed field information, see the API Documentation at:

icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"].
