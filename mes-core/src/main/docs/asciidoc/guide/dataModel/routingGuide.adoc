=== Routing

A link:reference.html#routing[Routing^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]
is a sequence of operations needed to manufacture a <<Product>>.
These operations can be simple actions
such as _ASSEMBLE_ or _TEST_. They may also be a composite operation that is made up of several
actions that are not tracked within SimpleMES.

Some examples are:

* 10 - ASSEMBLE
* 20 - PAINT
* 30 - PACK
* 40 - TEST

The routing may be a master routing that can be used on multiple products or it may be specific
to a single product. This decision is made when defining the product.

Operations can be optionally defined to execute within a <<WorkCenter>>.  This is useful to
limit where specific operations can be performed.

For detailed field information, see the API Documentation at:
