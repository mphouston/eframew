Security is critical in enterprise applications.  This MES Core module depends on the
link:{eframe-path}/guide.html#security[Security^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]
provided by the enterprise framework.
In your application development, you will need to follow the
link:{eframe-path}/guide.html#security-setup[Security Setup^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]
notes for the similar setup for the framework.


This MES Core module provides some <<Roles>> for application security levels.
All controllers will enforce the appropriate security role.
