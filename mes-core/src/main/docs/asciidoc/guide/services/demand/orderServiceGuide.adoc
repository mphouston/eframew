This service's methods are exposed by the
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/mes/demand/controller/OrderController.html[OrderController^]
icon:share-square[role="link-blue"].  This controller supports the request/response POGOs
in JSON format.



==== release()

The `release()` method is used to release an order to the shop floor for processing.  The entire order or a portion
of the order can be released.  Automatic LSN generation, if needed, occurs at release time.
See <<lsn>> for details on when LSNs are automatically generated.

NOTE: This method is part of the <<Stable API>> icon:balance-scale[role="link-blue"].

This method is exposed via HTTP in the `/order/release` URI.
See link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/mes/demand/OrderController.html[OrderController^] icon:share-square[role="link-blue"].


===== Request and Response

This method takes a request object
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/mes/demand/OrderReleaseRequest.html[OrderReleaseRequest^] icon:share-square[role="link-blue"]
and returns the response
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/mes/demand/OrderReleaseResponse.html[OrderReleaseResponse^] icon:share-square[role="link-blue"].



==== archiveOld()

Archiving is used to move an order to an JSON file to reduce the amount of data in the database.  This
will archive a single order and all of its children and history records at a time.

The `archiveOld()` method is used to archive old, done orders based on the date that they were completed.
There are options for the age (days) and the max number of orders to archive in one batch (transaction).
There is also an option to limit the number batches archived at a time.  This last option is used to
limit the slowdown from archiving during 'catch-up' scenarios when
archiving has not been run recently.

NOTE: The archive feature is described in more details at
link:{eframe-path}/guide.html#archiving[Archiving(framework)^] icon:share-square[role="link-blue"].
