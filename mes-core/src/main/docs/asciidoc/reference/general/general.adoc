This is the reference for the SimpleMES application.  The goal of this document is to provide in-depth details on
most aspects of the application.  The Groovydoc (Javadoc)
link:groovydoc/index.html[API^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]
covers other details of the underlying classes, but this document explains the higher-level
features and behavior.

For a high-level treatment of these features, see the <<guide.adoc#introduction,User Guide>>.
