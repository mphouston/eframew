icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] control how <<LSN,LSNs>> keys are automatically generated
for an <<Order>>. The format of these LSNs is quite flexible.  The LSN can be based on the order,
the date or other related values.

The format string can contain replaceable parameters that are used to generate a unique
or semi-unique LSN.  These replaceable parameters are listed as _$order_ in the format string.
At generation time, these strings are replaced by the actual value in use at the time.

The replaceable parameters for LSNs are:

.Replacable Parameters for LSNs
[cols="2,6",width=75%]
|===
| Parameter | Description

| *$currentSequence* | A semi-unique sequence that is incremented after each code is generated.
| *$order.order*   | The parent order for this LSN.
| *$product.product* | The product that the parent order is to build.
| _Standard Parameters_| All of the standard parameters for a <<CodeSequence>> (e.g. `date`).
|=== 

These order and product parameters are the full order and product objects.  This means you can
use fields of those objects in creation of the LSN strings.  For example:

[source,groovy]
.Example - LSN Sequence
----
${order.product?.product ?: 'DEFAULT'}
----

This will use the product in the format string. If the order has no product, then the string
_'DEFAULT'_ will be used.

The question mark ('?') syntax is used to avoid null pointer exceptions in the code.
The _'?:'_ syntax is standard Groovy syntax which means: if the left side is null,
then use the right side.
