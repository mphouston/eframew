icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] control how <<order,Orders>> keys are automatically generated
for an Order that has no order value. The format of these Orders is quite flexible.
The LSN can be based on the product, the date or other related values.

The format string can contain replaceable parameters that are used to generate a unique
or semi-unique Order key.  These replaceable parameters are specified like _$product.product_
in the format string for the sequence definition. At generation time, these strings are replaced
by the actual value in use at the time.

The replaceable parameters for Orders are:

|===
| Parameter | Description

| *$currentSequence* | A semi-unique sequence that is incremented after each code is generated.
| *$product.product* | The product that the parent order is to build.
| _Standard Parameters_| All of the standard parameters for a <<CodeSequence>> (e.g. `date`).

.Example - Order Sequence
----
${product?.product ?: 'ACME'}
----

This will use the product in the format string. If the order has no product, then the string
_'ACME'_ will be used.

The question mark ('?') syntax is used to avoid null pointer exceptions in the code.
The _'?:'_ syntax is standard Groovy syntax which means: if the left side is null,
then use the right side.
