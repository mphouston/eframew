=== ProductionLog

The link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/mes/tracking/domain/ProductionLog.html[ProductionLog^]
icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]
class represents the result of a production action on the shop floor.
Typically, this is written when the order/LSN is taken out of work so that the
elapsed time can be calculated.
This includes actions like complete and reverse start.

These records are designed to exist without direct references to other domain objects.  This means
the references use the primary key field for the object (e.g. Order, LSN, etc).  Those referenced
objects can be archived and these production log records can be kept in the database 
longer than the other domain objects if needed.


See link:guide.html#productionlog[ProductionLog^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]
for an overview and details on archiving.
