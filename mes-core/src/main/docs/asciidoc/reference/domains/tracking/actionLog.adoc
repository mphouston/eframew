=== ActionLog

The link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/mes/tracking/domain/ActionLog.html[ActionLog^]
icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]
class is used to record all important actions for a specific element (e.g. Order or LSN).
Actions such as Release, Start and Complete a logged here.


These records are designed to exist as long as the owning objects (e.g. _Order_) are in the database.
The records are archived when the owning objects are archived.  This is something the <<Order>> object
handles with its `findRelatedRecords()` method to find the _ActionLog_ records.

See link:guide.html#actionlog[ActionLog^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]
for an overview.
