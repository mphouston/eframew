global tasks.

This service's methods are exposed by the

==== release()

.release(<<OrderReleaseRequest>>) returns <<OrderReleaseResponse>>


The `release()` method is used to release an order to the shop floor for processing.  The entire order or
a portion of the order can be released.  Automatic LSN generation, if needed, occurs at release time.
See <<lsn>> for details on when LSNs are automatically generated.

NOTE: This method is part of the <<Stable API>> icon:balance-scale[role="green"].

==== Order Service Extension Points

Many other modules may need to extend core methods with module-specific logic.  We allow this
using the framework's
link:{eframe-path}/guide.html#extension-points[Extension Points^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]
feature.  The extension points in this service include:
