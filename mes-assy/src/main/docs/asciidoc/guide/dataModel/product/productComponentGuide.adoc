=== Product Component (BOM)

The <<reference.adoc#product-component,ProductComponent>> a single component requirement for a
specific <<Product>>.
A Bill of Material (BOM) is a list of the  components needed to build a given product.  This BOM can contain
manufactured or purchased products as components for the manufactured product.

Components are just another product that is assembled into a final product.  These can be manufactured
or purchased from an outside supplier. 

The BOM is added to the core MES <<Product>> GUIs by this module.  It allows you to define which components
(other products) that must be assembled to make an assembly.  This includes the quantity required.

The BOM is stored in the

domain class, which is a custom child list extension to the core Product domain.
