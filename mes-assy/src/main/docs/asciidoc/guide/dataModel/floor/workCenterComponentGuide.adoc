=== Work Center Component

A <<reference.adoc#work-center-component,Work Center Component>>  defines a single component loaded
onto the given <<Work Center>>.
This includes a `location` to track where the component is.  This location can be a bin, hopper, shelf or
and automated feeder location.  This domain also is used to record the long-term history of
components loaded on the work center.

This element informally belongs to the MES Core
link:{mes-core-path}/guide.html#work-center[Work Center^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]
parent.  Since the Work Center is in another module, the normal child relationship notation can't be used.
Instead, this addition provides a delete check before allowing the work center to be deleted.

The assembly data (e.g. the supplier, lot code, date code, etc) are stored in a
<<{eframe-path}/guide.adoc#flexible-fields,Flexible Field>> based on the `assemblyData` Flex Type.
This means the actual assembly data is stored in XML in the field `assemblyDataValues`.
This allows the GUIs to collect configurable data from your operators without forcing any database
or other customizations.

The components setup currently on a Work Center are maintained in the Work Center Component Setup
page:

This GUI uses the _WorkCenterComponentController_ to maintain the components.

==== Component History

TBD - Records history of component usage, with the `state` field.
