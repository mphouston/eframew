This part of the assembly module provides the ability to automatically assemble components loaded into
within a work center.  This is done automatically when an Order ot LSN is started or completed at a work center.
Most of these features are configurable by the end user.

=== Why use Auto Assembly?

In many manual production shops, you need to assemble a number of components into a final product for delivery
to your customers. For liability reasons, you need to track key components that are used in every product you
deliver. For example, this is used by automobile manufacturers to know which cars need to be recalled when a
defective component is identified.

One way to do this is to manually record every component used.  This can be done in SimpleMES, but it is tedious
and error-prone.  A better approach is to use a common work center feature to reduce the data entry needed.

Many assembly work centers use _bins_ to hold components to be assembled into the product.  These bins are
typically replenished with a new lot of components when empty.  SimpleMES can be used to record this new lot
in the work center.  Then, the auto assembly logic will assume this new lot is used on all later orders
produced at the work center.

This reduces the user input and risk of errors.  An example is shown below.

In the example above, the work center _WC1_ is loaded with two components from LOT-A and LOT-B.  Then,
the order _ORDER1_ is started at the work center.  The components are automatically assembled into
the order.  From this point on, the component history for this order will indicate that LOT-A and
LOT-B were used on this order.

=== How does this work?

This Assembly addition (module) adds an option to the core RoutingOperation object to let you
decide when this automatic assembly takes place.  Then, the work center _WC1_ is loaded with the
component DISK from the supplier lot _LOT-A_ and FAN from the supplier lot _LOT-B_.

Before any orders are processed, the current component lots are loaded into the work center.
You inform the system using the <<Work Center Assembly Service>> or GUI that specific components
are being used in the work center.

When order _ORDER1_ is started at the work center, the components loaded into the work center are copied to
the orders component history.

See <<Product Addition>> for details on how the Product is modified to define what data to collect when
a component is assembled.

The components setup currently on a Work Center are maintained in the Work Center Component Setup
page:

=== Routing Operation Addition

Auto Assembly provides an option at the RoutingOperation that lets you decide when to auto-assemble
the components from the work center's setup into the order or LSN.  the options allowed are defined in the
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/mes/assy/AssemblyModeEnum.html[AssemblyModeEnum^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]
enumeration.

|Value | Description
| `NONE`| No automatic assembly processing at this operation.
| `START`| Auto-assemble from work center setup on start.

| `START_COMPLETE`| Auto-assemble from work center setup on start and complete.

=== Work Center Component Addition

This domain class works with the core Work Center domain to define the components setup on a work center.
This includes the current setup and all historical values.  The flex data fields may be used from the Product
definition to define the data fields needed to identify the component.

For more details see the <<work-center-guide,Work Center Guide>> or
<<reference.adoc#work-center,Work Center Reference>>


[[work-service-addition-intro]]
=== Work Service Addition

The Work Service is extended to support this auto assembly.  The `start()` and `complete()` methods are
extended to auto assemble components from the work center setup, if it is configured properly.  To work,
these things must be configured:

* The Operation is marked to auto assemble at start and/or complete.  See <<Routing Operation Addition>>.
* The work center is setup with the components.
* An order or LSN is started/completed at the operation.
