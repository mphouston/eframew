=== Introduction

This MES Assembly plugin provides most of the business logic of assembly as services.
These services use the domain objects to affect the
persistent state of objects.

See the link:{mes-core-path}/guide.html#services[MES Core Services^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]
for an overview of how the domain objects and services interact.  This includes working with input
arguments and database transactions.
