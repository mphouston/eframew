This Assembly module is used to identify components that are added to Orders or LSNs in production.
Reports provide a way to identify the components used in your shipped products.  This can be very
useful to help identify product recall issues, perhaps years after production.

=== Additions to MES-Core

This module makes a number of additions to the core MES module.  This addition adds related
domain classes to support logging of components assembled into orders and LSNs.
See <<Data Model>> for details.

==== Product Addition

This module adds features to the core <<Product>> objects to support assembly of components into
orders/LSNs.  This includes definition and production actions using the <<product-component-guide>>
custom domain.

===== Components Required (BOM)

This module also adds a list of components needed to produce a <<Product>>.  This custom child
object (<<product-component-guide>>) is used to determine what components are needed to produce an order.

===== Assembly Data Type

The overall Assembly module adds a new field to the core Product definition.  This defines the flex data fields
needed for a component when it is assembled.  For example, it might include a lot number from a supplier.

This is used whenever a component is assembled by the user.
This includes manual assembly and scanner-based assembly.


==== Order Addition

This module adds logic to to the core <<Order>> features to support assembly of components into orders.

===== Order Release

This module adds logic to the core `OrderService.release()` logic to copy the Product components to the order.
These records are a simple copy of the <<product-component-guide>> records for the Product.

This module also provides additional assembly-related methods in the <<Order Assy Service>>.
This includes reading, adding and removing components for the order/LSN.

===== Component Assembly

This module adds the <<Order Assy Service>> to support assembly of components into an order/LSN.
This records the historical components used on the order as well as the current components.


==== Scan Support

The link:{mes-core-path}/guide.html#scan-dashboard[core Scan Dashboard^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]
provides a way to quickly process work on the shop floor using a simple barcode scanner.  It provides
ways to start and complete and order/LSN in a scan-oriented dashboard:

This Assembly module adds support for scanning components for assembly.
This includes these types of barcodes:

* Component with assembly data (Serial Number) in a formatted barcode.
* Component scan, followed by one or more assembly data scans.

See <<reference.adoc#barcode-prefixes,Barcode Prefixes>> for details on encoding multi-part
barcodes.  A sample barcode using the internal format is:

  ^PRD^WHEEL-27^VND^ACME_WHEELS^LOT^200171023

This defines the values:

* *Product component*: _WHEEL-27_
* *Vendor*: _ACME_WHEELS_
* *Lot*: _200171023_

The assembly addition to the Scan logic can assemble this component/lot automatically for an order
using a single scan.

For automatic handling of the component scanning, you must meet the following conditions:

* The <<Order>> should have a BOM (the Product has a <<product-component-guide, BOM>>).  
* The <<Product>> has defined an `assemblyDataType`.
* The barcode combines the product and the assembly data needed (e.g. a Lot Code).  See example above.

==== Assembly Scan Flow

The basic flow for a structured barcode (e.g. _\^PRD^WHEEL..._) is:

. If the core logic has resolved the scan, then do nothing.
. Extract the component scanned and any assembly data (e.g. lot).
. If the component's product has an assembly data type that does not match *ANY* field in the
  barcode, then a dialog is displayed on the client to collect the assembly data.
. If the component is a valid Product, add the component to the order/LSN with the barcode's assembly data.
  If the component is not found in the BOM, then the component is assembled as a non-BOM component.

If the component is listed multiple times in the order's BOM, then the first un-assembled component is used.
Once the full quantity is assembled, any excess will be assigned to first matching component.

If the component's product has an assembly data type, then only the barcode's fields that match the flex type's
fields are logged in the assembly record.

The basic flow for a simple barcode (e.g. _WHEEL_) is:

. If the core logic has resolved the scan, then do nothing.
. If the scanned value is not a Product, then no action is taken.
. If the scanned value is a Product with no assembly data to collect, then the component is assembled without
  the data.  If the component is not in the BOM, then it is assembled as a non-BOM component.
. If the scanned value is a Product with assembly data to collect, then a dialog is displayed on the client
  to collect the assembly data.  See link:reference.html#assembly-scan-activity[Assembly Scan Activity^]
  icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] for details.

==== LSN Use

If you are assembling using LSNs, then most of the assembly logic assumes you will use LSNs for the same component
in a given order.    You can mix order and LSN-based assembled in different components all you want.

You should not mix modes for a single component. If you do, then the detection of already assembled components
will be inconsistent.  In most cases, the detection of already assembled components will ignore the order-based
quantities.

==== No BOM

If the order's product has no BOM, then assembly is still possible.  If you scan a component barcode,
then assembly will take place.  No BOM requirement will be fulfilled.
