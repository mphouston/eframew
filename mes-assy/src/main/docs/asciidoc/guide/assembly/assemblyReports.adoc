One of the most important features of assembly is the ability to find what orders/LSNs used
a specific component.  This is needed for recall purposes and for some governmental regulations.
SimpleMES provides a full-text search mechanism to let you find specific orders/LSN that use
a given component.  The main starting point for this is the <<Component Report>>.  This component
report provides links to the detailed <<Order/LSN Assembly Report>>.

=== Searching

SimpleMES will index all assembly data entered by the operators. This allows a full-text search
on the data collected during assembly.  Typically, this will include data collected for the
assembly data type (a flex type) fields.  For example, you might collect a `LOT` and `VENDOR`
during the assembly process.  If you want to find all orders that used anything with the text
_'65028937-011'_, then you could search with:

  65028937-011

This would find any order that has the text _'65028937-011'_ in its data.  This could match things
other than the LOT.   To limit your search to just the `LOT` field, you could search with:

  lot:65028937-011

This will find just records that have the value _'65028937-011'_ in the Flex Type field `LOT`.

NOTE: The text _'lot:'_  is a simple short-hand that is expanded into the correct search term.  The report
      will show the actual search term used.

=== Component Report

When you need to find the orders/LSNs that used a given component lot, this report is the best
starting place for your search.  This report will perform a full-text search for any text entered.
It also supports the syntax for searching on just a single flex type field (e.g. _'lot:65028937-011'_).

The orders/LSNs found with the component will be displayed in a simple list with a hyper-link to
the detailed <<Order/LSN Assembly Report>>.
