== General


This is the reference for the SimpleMES Assembly module.  The goal of this document is to provide in-depth details on
most aspects of the module.  The Groovydoc (Javadoc) link:groovydoc/index.html[API^] covers other details of the
underlying classes, but this document explains the higher-level features and behavior.

For more information on APIs, conventions, standard fields and status codes, see the
link:{mes-core-path}/reference.html#[Core Reference^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"].
This assembly module conforms to those conventions.

This reference is broken up into the main object types (e.g. Domain, Service) and then
sub-divided by primary package (Floor, Product, Demand, etc.).
