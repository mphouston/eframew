A dashboard is an instrument panel that gives your users information and allows them to control some parts of your
application.  Typically, this dashboard allows configuration so that your users can tailor the display and
behavior to their needs.  These dashboards can display one or more pages in a resizable set of panels so that
a lot of information can be visible to your users to operate on.
