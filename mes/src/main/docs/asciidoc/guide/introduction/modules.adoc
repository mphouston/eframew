== Modules

This application is made up of a number of modules (plugins).  Each module is documented separately
with user guides, reference docs and the Groovy API documents:

=== Planned Modules

link:#core[Core,role="inline-toc"]
link:#assembly[Assembly,role="inline-toc"]
link:#defect-tracking[Defect Tracking (0.9),role="inline-toc"]
link:#complex-assembly[Complex Assembly (TBD),role="inline-toc"]


An MES is a complex application.  It has many features that may not be needed by all users.
For example, defect tracking may not be needed for a high-volume manufacturer, but is indispensable
for customers who do complex assembly (e.g. aerospace).
To keep things simple for basic users, SimpleMES can be re-configured with optional modules to
provide less-used features.

The link:{eframe-path}/guide.html#[Enterprise Framework^] icon:share-square[role="link-blue"]
 provides a way to break a complex application into multiple modules.
This allows you to modularize your application into one or more plugins.
These plugins can work with each other and provide new features to core module (plugin).
This provides the ability to add fields to core domain objects, extend the functionality of service
methods, ask questions in core GUIs and to participate in database transactions with core objects.

Why hide features in MES?  Because many features are complex and require extra setup to work properly.
A simpler user interface is always preferable to a complex interface with many options.  If the user
does not need a feature, then it is best not to overload the displays with unused options.

One common configuration for SimpleMES is shown below:

This configures the deployed MES with the two most common modules: Assembly and Defect Tracking.
It is also possible to use industry-specific modules such as the Complex Assembly module when those
features are needed.



The specific features of each module are covered in the documentation of the module, but a quick overview
is useful.

=== Core

This module (core) is documented here, but the key features include:

* link:{mes-core-path}/guide.html#product[Product^] icon:share-square[role="link-blue"] - The product to be manufactured.
* link:{mes-core-path}/guide.html#routing[Routing^] icon:share-square[role="link-blue"] - The detailed steps needed to produce the product.
* link:{mes-core-path}/guide.html#work-center[Work Center^] icon:share-square[role="link-blue"] - The machine, area or people needed to produce a product.  Includes basic setup.
* link:{mes-core-path}/guide.html#order[Order^] icon:share-square[role="link-blue"] - The order from your customer (e.g. a shop order).
* link:{mes-core-path}/guide.html#lsn[LSN^] icon:share-square[role="link-blue"] - The Lot/Serial Number for specific pieces or lots produced.

=== Assembly

See link:{mes-assy-path}/guide.html[Assembly^] icon:share-square[role="link-blue"] for details.  The key features include:

* Ability to scan to assemble components.
* link:{mes-assy-path}/guide.html#product-component-guide[BOM^] icon:share-square[role="link-blue"] - The Bill of Materials (product components) needed to build the product.

=== Defect Tracking

See http://docs.simplemes.org/mes-defect/latest/[Defect Tracking^] icon:share-square[role="link-blue"] for details.  The key features include:

* link:../../mes-defect/html5/guide.html#defect[Defect^] icon:share-square[role="link-blue"] - A basic defect found on product.
* link:../../mes-defect/html5/guide.html#defect-log[Defect Log^] icon:share-square[role="link-blue"] - The defects found on orders/LSNs.

=== Complex Assembly

See http://docs.simplemes.org/mes-complex/latest/[Complex Assembly^] icon:share-square[role="link-blue"] for details.  The key features include:

* link:../../mes-defect/html5/guide.html#assembly-order[Assembly Order^] icon:share-square[role="link-blue"] - An assembly order.
