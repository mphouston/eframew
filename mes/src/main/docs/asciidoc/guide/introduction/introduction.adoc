http://docs.simplemes.org/mes/latest/[SimpleMES^] is THE open source Manufacturing Execution System
(http://www.mesa.org/en/modelstrategicinitiatives/MESAModel.asp[MES^]).  The purpose of an MES is to
control and track what happens on your shop floor. SimpleMES is designed to simplify the complex and
time-consuming task of implementing a traditional MES.
The main features are:

* Minimal setup.
* Easy configuration.
* Easy customization.
* Cloud-ready.

=== What is an MES?

A Manufacturing Execution System (MES) helps manufacturers track and control how they build their
products.  An MES is designed to be used by shop floor personnel such as operators, supervisors and managers.
These people will use the system to record their actions while building your products.  This recorded
data is then later used to track down problems and help fix them.  These problems can be a simple
as a bad lot of components from a vendor to defects found in the inspection process.

The data collected can help you evaluate the performance of your shop.  It can also help you
locate specific orders/products and provide instance status updates for your customers.
You can use the MES data to track historical costs and build times for your products. This
can be very useful when planning new projects.

An MES is typically the primary interface between your shop floor personnel and your systems.
This gives the operators a simple interface to the key actions they perform dozens of times a day.
This also reduces the manual paperwork needed to track what took place on the floor.


=== Why Do You Need an MES?

The key benefits of using an MES include:

* Reduced paperwork.
* Better tracking of shop floor actions.
* Better visibility to shop floor state.
* Early problem identification.
* Regulatory compliance.

Most of these benefits center on the data collected by an MES.  SimpleMES can collect a lot of data.
However, these benefits are not automatic with zero cost to you.
This cost is mainly due to operating the MES system and the user time spent interacting with the MES.
SimpleMES tries to minimize the costs while letting you have the benefits.

By letting you choose how much data collection is needed during production, you can choose how much using
the MES will cost you.  It is very important to only collect the data you need.  Later, you can expand
your use of the MES for other benefits.


=== What Data can an MES Collect?


SimpleMES can collect a lot of data.  This includes:

* What was built.
* Who built it.
* When it was built and how long it took to build.
* The work center where it was built.
* The components used to built it.
* The defects found and repaired for the product.
* Configurable data collected at key points (e.g. assembly or defect processing).

This data is stored in the database and can be used in many ways to help you work with your shop floor.


==== Reduced Paperwork

Like most aspects of life, manufacturing requires a lot of paperwork to track what you build
and how you build it.  Most of your customers require inspection data, component usage and other
production data.  The traditional way to supply this was via paperwork shipped with the product.

Today, most customers require digital data delivered with the product.  An MES will allow easier
creation of much of this data for your customers.

==== Traceability

Traceability is an important part of manufacturing. When a defective component lot from a supplier is
used in a product, you need to know which orders or serial numbers used these components.
This is critical for product recall scenarios.

By using the <<Assembly>> module features, you can decide what to collect when a component is assembled
by an operator.  This data can be quickly searched using the Component Report to find where a specific
component lot was used.  You can also review the components used on a specific order/LSN to
help diagnose the source of component-related problems.

==== Control

Beyond tracking what happens on the shop floor, you can also control the actions that are performed
on your products.  This is done by defining routings and bills of materials (BOMs) for your products.
SimpleMES will help guide your operators to perform the steps in the right order and to assemble
the components needed.

You can also control what actions a given user can perform.  This is controlled by the security roles
you can assign to you users.

==== Performance

The performance of your shop floor is critical to your success.  It is important to find problems with
the performance before it reduces you efficiency.  The production log records the actual production
time/results for the shop floor.  This forms the basis for most reports that let you determine how
well your shop floor is operating.

==== Regulation Compliance

Many industries are regulated by the government.  These regulations frequently control how you
build, inspect and repair products. An MES can help you document how you comply with these regulations.
In particular, the MES can track who and how the product is built.  This is cornerstone of most
regulations about manufactured products.

An MES can also help control how you build the products.  Many regulations require you to have a
documented production process.  The MES product definitions such as routings and BOMs can form the core
of this process documentation.

==== Real-time Status

In almost all shop floors, you need to know exactly what is happening on the floor in real time.
When using an MES, you can quickly find specific orders and determine their status.  You can also
monitor real-time performance and help identify performance issues early.

The data in SimpleMES forms the basis for a real-time status reporting.  These are reports that
give you the current status.

==== Track Costs

Tracking production costs is a key part of knowing if you are profitable or not.  It is also needed to help
you determine the price you charge your customers.  Without knowing your costs, it is difficult to
set an accurate price for your products.

SimpleMES does not support a costing module at this time.  Instead, you can use the production
log history to determine your costs.  These costs come from these key areas:

* Labor time.
* Component Costs.
* Losses (time and material).
* Machine usage.
* Defect handling.

SimpleMES gives you the data you can use to determine your costs in these areas.  The key data source
is the production log.  You also can use the component history to determine the component usages
for your shipped products.




=== MES and Other Systems

An MES usually operates between an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system and the
shop floor.  Most ERP systems are not designed to be used on the shop floor.  An MES is generally
more flexible to handle the unique procedures needed on your shop floor.

An MES is not a shop floor automation controller.  Running automated/CNC devices is usually handled
by specially designed software that knows how to control physical machines such as robots and conveyors.
An MES will usually interface to those systems, if needed in your shop.

NOTE: An ERP system or shop floor automation system is not required for SimpleMES.  SimpleMES is very
      useful by itself in most small to medium shops.
