This tutorial covers assembly of components into an order using the barcode-scan oriented
dashboard.  See <<Assembly>> for details on how to assemble with just
keyboard input.

[[scan-setup]]
=== Setup

Some setup is needed for this tutorial.  You will need to follow these steps:

. <<Logging In>>.
. <<Create a Dashboard>> (Operator Assembly).
. Configure your barcode scanner to send the data to the browser as keyboard input.
. Configure your barcode scanner to send a TAB character as the suffix after the data is sent.

If you don't have a barcode scanner, then you can simulate the scanner's behavior by typing
in the values using a keyboard, followed bya TAB key.  The dashboard will display the
text as you type.


[[scan-define-product]]
=== Define product

Next, you will need to define a product with some components. If you followed the
<<Create a Dashboard>> steps above, then these products will be created by the demo data loading
step:

image::guis/productList.png[title="Product List",align="center", width="650"]

The Bill of Material for the product _BIKE-27_ will require two components:

. _SEAT_ - *Quantity 1* - Data Collected on Assembly: _LOT_.
. _WHEEL-27_ - *Quantity 2* - Data Collected on Assembly: _LOT_.

You can create your own product structure for this demo if you like, but the screenshots
below will use the above structure.

[[scan-create-release-order]]
=== Create and Release the Order

Now, you need to create an Order.

. You will need to open the Order List page using the
  link:{eframe-path}/guide.html#task-menu[Task Menu^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"].

. To create a new order, press the image:guis/orderCreateButton.png[width="100",title="Create"]
 button. This displays the Create Order page:
+
image::guis/orderCreate.png[title="Create Order", align="center", width="750"]


. Fill in the required fields (marked with "*") and select the `Product` you created above
  (_BIKE-27_).  Make sure the `Overall Status` is set to _Ready_.

. Press the image:guis/createButton.png[width="80",title="Create"] button.
  This displays the order in the Show Order page:
+
image::guis/orderShow.png[title="Show Order", align="center", width="750"]
+
The order has been created, but is not yet released to production.

. Press the image:guis/releaseButton.png[width="45"] button
  (on the far right side of the toolbar).
  This displays confirmation message:
+
image::guis/orderReleased.png[title="Order Released", align="center", width="750"]


[[scan-print-traveller]]
=== Print Traveller for Barcode Scanner

Now, you can optionally print a traveller document for easy barcode-scanning.
For this, we will use the _Manager Assembly_ dashboard:

. Open the _Manager_ dashboard using the
  link:{eframe-path}/guide.html#task-menu[Task Menu^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]:
+
image::guis/dashboard.png[title="Manager Dashboard", align="center", width="750"]
+
This dashboard provides access to the Reports.

. Select the order.
. Press the _Reports_ button.
. Press the _Traveller_ report button.  This displays the Traveller Report:
+
image::guis/traveller.png[title="Traveller Report", align="center", width="750"]
+
This _Traveller_ report shows the components required with a barcode for the component.
On the second page of the traveller, some sample barcodes are printed to demonstrate the
supported
link:{mes-core-path}/guide.html#barcode-formats[Barcode Formats^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"].
You can create your own barcodes using online sites such as
link:https://www.onlinelabels.com/label-generator-tools/barcode-generator.aspx[www.onlinelabels.com].
The sample components look like this:
+
image::guis/travellerSampleComponents.png[title="Traveller - Sample Components", align="center", width="550"]
+
. Print this from the web-page or as a PDF.



[[scan-start-order]]
=== Start the Order

Next, you will switch to the _Operator Assembly_ dashboard, which is a barcode scanner oriented
dashboard:

. Open the _Operator Assembly_ dashboard using the
  link:{eframe-path}/guide.html#task-menu[Task Menu^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]:
+
image::guis/dashboardScanAssy.png[title="Operator Assembly Dashboard", align="center", width="750"]
+

. Scan the order ID (e.g. _M1005_ in the example below) to start work on the order.
  The status is changed to _In Work_ and the component list is displayed:
+
image::guis/dashboardScanAssyStarted.png[title="Operator Assembly Dashboard - Started", align="center", width="750"]
+


[[scan-assemble-components]]
=== Assemble Components

Now, you will assemble some components using the sample components from the traveller:

. Scan the first sample component (_SEAT_) from the traveller's second page:
+
image::guis/travellerSampleComponents.png[title="Traveller - Sample Components", align="center", width="550"]
+
. Scan the second sample component (_WHEEL-27_) from the traveller's second page:
This will assemble the components with the dummy lot: _ACME14327_.  (Both components have the
same dummy lot in the traveller report).
+
image::guis/dashboardScanAssembled.png[title="Scan Dashboard - Assembled Components", align="center", width="750"]
+

. *Alternative*: You could also just scan the component (e.g. _SEAT_) and then enter the lot
in the dialog:
+
image::guis/dashboardAssembleComponent.png[title="Add Component Dialog", align="center", width="450"]
+



[[scan-complete-order]]
=== Complete the Order

Next, you will complete work on the order by just scanning the order a second time:

. Scan the order ID (e.g. _M1005_ in the example below) to complete work on the order.
  The status is changed to _..._:
+
image::guis/dashboardScanAssyCompleted.png[title="Operator Assembly Dashboard - Completed", align="center", width="750"]

[[scan-display-order-history]]
=== Display Order History

. Display the Manager dashboard (see <<scan-print-traveller,Print Traveller for Barcode Scanner>>).
. Select the order.
. Press the _Reports_ button.
. Press the _OrderHistory_ report button.  This displays the Order History Report.
+
image::guis/orderHistoryComponents.png[title="Order History Report - Components", align="center", width="750"]
+
This _Order History Report_ shows the component history details. Note the LOT information
entered during assembly.
