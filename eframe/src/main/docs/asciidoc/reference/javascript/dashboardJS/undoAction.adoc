.undoAction()

This Javascript function is part of the Dashboard
link:guide.html#undo[Undo^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] feature.
This preforms the most recent undo action logged from the server.   This removes it from the undo
stack. The next most recent action becomes the next undo action.  When there are no more undo actions
available, then the undo button is disabled.

This function is provided in the _dashboard.js_ library.

NOTE: You will normally not need to call this directly.  The dashboard will usually call it for you.
