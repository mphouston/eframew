A <<guide.adoc#dashboards,dashboard>> is an instrument panel that gives your users information and
allows them to control some parts of your application.  Typically, this dashboard allows
configuration so that your users can tailor the display and behavior to their needs.
These dashboards can display one or more pages in a resizable set of
panels so that a lot of information can be visible to your users to operate on.
