.getCurrentProvidedParameters()

This Javascript function returns a list of maps containing the provided parameters from all
current activities.

WARNING: This not needed for most activities.  Only use this for Non-GUI activities that have
         the `cache` option set to *true* or for static activities that need the current
         settings from another activity.
         Most other activities should rely on the request parameters when the activity
         content is rendered.
