=== Custom Dashboard Usage

This dashboard library is used with the <<efDashboard>> tag to handle the complex interactions
between the dashboard and its related activities.  The example below shows the basic usage of
the dashboard logic. The key methods are documented in this section.


NOTE: Any methods that start with and underscore (eg. __checkMissing_) are internal methods
      and are subject to change.


The standard dashboard .ftl file page is shown below.  Most applications won't need to
use this.  The default index.ftl file should work for most scenarios.

[source,html]
.Dashboard index.ftl
----
<#assign title><@efTitle type='main'/></#assign>
<#assign head>
  <script src="<@efAsset uri="dashboard.js"/>" type="text/javascript"></script> // <.>
</#assign>

<#include "../includes/header.ftl" />
<#include "../includes/definition.ftl" />

<@efDashboard category="${params.category!'OPERATOR'}"    // <.>
              dashboard="${params.dashboard}!''" />

<#include "../includes/footer.ftl" />

----
<.> The <<reference.adoc#dashboard-js,Dashboard JS>> library asset is loaded for the page.
<.> The `<@efDashboard>` tag displays the dashboard based on the passed in category or
    dashboard name (with default value).
