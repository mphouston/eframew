.loadDialogPreferences()

This Javascript function loads size/position preferences for the user into the page.
These preferences are set when the dialogs are moved/resized by the user.
When the dialog is later displayed by the page, these preferences will be used to place the dialog.

This is called automatically by
some of the <<Markers>> that use dialogs. You can call it directly in your page if needed.
The actual loading is done in the background, after
the HTML document is finished loading.

This function is part of the <<eframe-js>> library.
