The enterprise framework relies on a third-party GUI toolkit for much of the display
and layout in your application pages.  These use the javascript functions in the
_eframe_toolkit.js_ library to hide much of the toolkit-related dependencies.

NOTE: Any methods that start with an underscore (eg. `tk._alert()`) are internal methods
      and are subject to change.
