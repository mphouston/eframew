=== setSuggestURI

.setSuggestURI(textFieldName, uri)

This Javascript function updates the `suggest` URI for the given text field.
This allows you to dynamically change the <<Text Field Suggest>> URI and parameters
to reflect changes in the UI.  For example, a user may change the work center they are working
in.  The suggest mechanism can use the new work center to change how it suggests values.

This function is typically used with the <<Text Field Suggest>> option in the <<efField>>.
This function is part of the <<eframe_toolkit-js>> library.

The arguments are:

[cols=".^1,1,5"]
