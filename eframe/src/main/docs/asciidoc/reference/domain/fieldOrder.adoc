==== Field Ordering

Frequently, the framework features will need to list or display your domain fields in a logical
order. Framework markers such as <<efShow>> will show the fields in any order you like, but you
would have to update the <<efShow>> marker for every new field added to the domain class.
To simplify this maintenance task, the framework supports an optional `fieldOrder` static
variable in domain classes.

WARNING: Philosophical Discussion Ahead!


Field ordering is not traditionally part of a domain class's definition.  Following the
'Don't Repeat Yourself' philosophy, a central place to store the field ordering 'hints' is needed.
We chose the domain class. This is optional. If you don't want to embed field ordering in your
domain classes, then you can specify the field ordering on the respective
<<efShow>>, <<efCreate>> and <<efEdit>> markers in your .ftl files.  This means updating 3 files
whenever you add a new field to a domain class.  This is your choice.

The field ordering can also be configured by a user to add
<<guide.adoc#field-extension-gui,Field Extension GUI>>, move core fields and
remove core fields from the GUI.

===== Simple Ordering

Most simple domain classes will use just a simple list of fields in the order to be displayed.
Any fields not listed will *not* be displayed.

[source,groovy]
.Domain Class with fieldOrder
----
class Product {
  String product
  Status status
  String description
  BigDecimal lotSize

  static fieldOrder = ['product', 'status', 'lotSize', 'description']
}
----

The framework marker <<efShow>> can then be used to display these fields in the order you need:

[source,html]
.ftl Page Use
----
<@efShow fields="order,product,qtyToBuild,qtyDone,dateCompleted"/>
----

Now, you can add a new field to the domain without updating your .ftl files.  You only have to
remember to add the new field(s) to the `fieldOrder` variable.  See the
<<Testing fieldOrder Variable>> for details on how you can verify that all fields are
listed in the `fieldOrder` variable.


===== Grouping of Field (Panels)

Simple grouping of fields is possible when you use a _'group:name'_ value in your
`fieldOrder` variable.
An example is shown below, with the `fieldOrder` setting needed for it.

[source,groovy]
.Domain Class with Grouping
----
class Product {
  String name
  String title
  BigDecimal qty
  Integer count
  Boolean enabled
  Date dateTime
  DateOnly dueDate
  String notes

  static fieldOrder = ['name', 'title', 'qty', 'count', 'enabled', 'dueDate', 'dateTime',
                       'group:details', 'notes']
}
----

In the <<efShow>> marker, this will create two tabbed panels: 'Main' and 'Details'.  The titles for
these tabs will be pulled from the _messages.properties_ file entry as shown below:

[source,groovy]
.messages.properties (Framework Tab Names)
----
custom.panel.label=Custom
details.panel.label=Details
main.panel.label=Main
----

Any other panel labels will need to be defined in your _messages.properties_ file.

By default, if any group is defined, all fields up to the first 'group' entry will be placed in
a panel titled _'Main'_. You can change the label for this first panel as you wish by specifying
it in the `fieldOrder` variable:

[source,groovy]
----
class Product {
  static fieldOrder = ['group:first', 'product', 'status', 'lotSize',
                       'group:details.label', 'assemblyData', 'routing']
}
----

If the _'first'_ panel has no localized label, the text _'first'_ will be displayed.  This allows
custom panels to use the label as-is.


===== Testing fieldOrder Variable

We recommend that you test to your domain class tests to ensure that all fields are
accounted for in the `fieldOrder` variable.  The helper class
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/test/DomainTester.html[DomainTester^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]
tests the `fieldOrder` by default:


[source,groovy]
.Example Domain Test
----
def "verify that user domain enforces constraints"() {
  expect: 'the constraints are enforced'
  DomainTester.test {
    domain Order
    requiredValues order: 'M1003', qty: 2.0       // <.>
    maxSize 'order', FieldSizes.MAX_CODE_LENGTH   // <.>
    maxSize 'password', 128
    notNullCheck 'userName'                       // <.>
    notNullCheck 'password'
    notInFieldOrder (['authorities', 'password']) // <.>
  }
}
----
<.> Defines the required values for the domain record.
<.> Verifies that the max length is enforced.
<.> Verifies that null values are prevented.
<.> Checks that the <<reference.adoc#field-order,fieldOrder>> is defined correctly for the
    domain class. Verifies that all persistent fields are listed in the `fieldOrder` list.

You can also disable the fieldOrder check with the option *'fieldOrderCheck false'*.
