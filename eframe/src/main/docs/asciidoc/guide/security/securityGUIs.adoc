=== Security GUIs

The framework comes with basic GUIs for creating/maintaining users and roles.  It also provides
standard login/logout mechanisms.   The login page is automatically displayed by the Micronaut
Security module.  The logout action is added
to all GUIs in your by code in the _views/includes/header.ftl_ include file.

[source,html]
.Example use of header.ftl
----
<#assign title>Home Title</#assign> // <.>

<#include "../includes/header.ftl" /> // <.>

 . . .

<#include "../includes/footer.ftl" />

----
<.> Sets the title for the header to use.
<.> Starts the HTML page, including _<head>_ and _<body>_ blocks.


This adds a form that submits the logout request with the POST method.  The logout link is only
shown if a user is currently logged in.

This POST/Form mechanism is needed for the default configuration for the
security module.
