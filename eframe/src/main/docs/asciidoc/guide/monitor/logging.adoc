Logging is a key part of monitoring and diagnosing enterprise applications.
You should monitor the logs to find problems before your users do.
This framework relies on the logging provided by https://www.slf4j.org/[Slf4j^] and
http://js.jsnlog.com/[JSNLog^].

This logging is configured from <<Micronaut logback.groovy>> or from the
<<Dynamic Logging Configuration>> page.


==== Levels

The framework uses the standard Log4j logging levels:

* *Fatal* - A system-wide fatal error has occurred.
* *Error* - A non-fatal error.
* *Warn* - A warning.  Something that should be investigated, but is not critical.
* *Info* - Information on the execution of the application.  Typically, performance timings are used here.
* *Debug* - Debugging information.  Depends on the class logging the information. Typically includes inputs, outputs and
            possible work arounds for bugs.
* *Trace* - Detailed debugging information.

By default, Error and Fatal messages are logged.  You can configure the system to log other messages for all classes
or for specific classes.

The Info, Debug and Trace levels are normally documented in the Javadoc for the class that issues the log message.


==== Logging Guidelines

Logging can be a big performance drain if done incorrectly.  The framework uses the simplest
http://www.slf4j.org/[Slf4j^] approach for best performance and clarity:

[source,groovy]
.Logging for Performance (Preferred Approach)
----
import groovy.util.logging.Slf4j

@Slf4j

   . . .

  log.trace("Summarizing Metric {}", metric) // <1>
----
<1> Uses replaceable parameter to avoid expensive `toString()` call if logging is not enabled.

This also helps with code coverage metrics.

It is best to avoid using these approaches:

[source,groovy]
.Logging - NOT Preferred
----
log.trace("Summarizing Metric $metric")

if (log.traceEnabled) {
  log.trace("Summarizing Metric $metric")
}
----

This works fine, but can hurt performance even if the log message is not written to the log.
The second option is more verbose.

==== Micronaut logback.groovy

The framework uses the normal logging mechanism from Micronaut (_logback.groovy_).
See http://logback.qos.ch/[Logback^] for details.


==== Dynamic Logging Configuration

The framework provides a GUI to display and temporarily adjust the logging levels for
many elements. This allows you to set the logging levels for controllers, domains and services.
It also provides other logger settings such as SQL tracing.

NOTE: Many loggers can produce a huge amount of data and can slow down your application.
      Please be careful when enabling logging on production servers.

Logging changes made in this GUI are not persistent.  You will need to use the
<<Micronaut logback.groovy>> approach for persistent changes.

This dynamic logging page shows all possible domains, controllers,services and client pages
that _might_ have logging available.  Not all entries listed have logging messages in their
code.

==== Stack Trace Logging

During development and testing, you generally want stack trace logged.    You can do this on
specific controllers (or the BaseController) as needed.

If you want to see some exception stack traces, then you can set the logging level for
'StackTrace' to debug.  This will make sure the stack trace is printed out in a number of cases
(e.g. from BaseController).

==== Javascript Client Logging

Many of the framework's javascript libraries and UIs use the http://jsnlog.com/[JSNLog^]
logging framework for this client-side logging.  The messages are logged to the javascript
console in the browser and optionally to the application server logs.  The JSNLog library is
part of the normal assets loaded into all pages by the _header.ftl_ include file.

This <<efGUISetup>> will check the systems logging level for the given page and set it when
the page is displayed.  If the logging level is changed on the server, the page must be refreshed
to use the new logging level.

The logging levels can also be configured from the standard <<Micronaut logback.groovy>>
file or from <<Dynamic Logging Configuration>> page.  There is a section that lists all
of the views and their current levels.  There are also two important entries at the top:

* *client* - The default level for all clients.  This is the parent
                logger for all client views.  This works the same as the package-level
                logger setting for Java classes.
* *client.to-server* - The logging level that means: send the client log message
                         to the server log.  This will echo the message in the server log.

WARNING: These two levels affect all clients.  These two
           settings can generate a huge amount of log data on the server. *Use Carefully*!.  


An example use of the logging framework is shown below:

[source,javascript]
.Example Javascript - Info Logging
----
JL().info("log message");
----

The default behavior of the client side logging is:

* Logging is written to the browser's javascript console.
* Important messages are sent to the server (along with recent lower-level messages).
