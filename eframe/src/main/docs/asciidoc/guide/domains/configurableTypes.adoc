Enterprise applications need to support user-configurable elements.  This allows your users to
tailor the behavior to suite their needs.  

How do you provide an open-ended list of options configured by the user?
Use *Configurable Types*.

For example, the RMA (Return Material Authorization) information for consumers is different
from the information provided by retailers. In addition to other data, the consumers might be
required to enter this information:

* Last Name
* First Name
* Address

A retailer might need to enter this information:

* Retailer ID
* Location ID
* Return Code (Defective, etc.)

You could add all of these fields to the RMA object and expect the user to decide which fields
are important.  Or, you could use some sort of configurable mechanism to decide which
fields are valid.

When creating the RMA record, the user will choose the RMA Type and the input fields for the
user will be configured based on that type.  This will look something like this:

image::guis/RMACreate.png[RMA Creation,align="center",width=75%]

When the user selects 'Consumer' as the type, then the consumer fields will be displayed.
When the user selects 'Retailer' as the type, then the retailer fields will be displayed.

The <<Definition Pages>> and the <<efField>> marker support this type of configurable field
when you use a <<Flex Types>> field or any field with a
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/data/ConfigurableTypeInterface.html[ConfigurableTypeInterface^]
icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"].  This allows you to simply use the core _FlexType_
class in a domain and the data is automatically displayed and saved in the definition pages:

[source,groovy]
.Example Flex Type Domain
----
class RMA {
  String rma
  String product
  BigDecimal qty
  Date returnDate

  @ManyToOne(targetEntity=FlexType) <.>
  FlexType rmaType

  @Nullable
  @ExtensibleFieldHolder  <.>
  @MappedProperty(type = DataType.JSON)
  String fields

}

----
<.> The field `rmaType` will hold the reference to the appropriate flex type.  The actual
    values will be stored in the `fields` field as described
    in <<Configurable Type Persistent Storage>>.
    Note the _@ManyToOne_ usage is needed for this <<Simple Foreign Reference>>.
<.> The FlexType requires a place to store the values for RMA records created.
    This is done in the normal location for <<Field Extensions>>.

It is also possible to define configurable types that are not based on <<Flex Types>>.
This requires more programming to provide the information needed. One example is
in the display/editing of the <<Report Filter Panel>> mechanism.


The flex type definition will look something like this:

image::guis/flexTypeCreate.png[title="flexTypeCreate",align="center", width=75%]


==== Configurable Type Persistent Storage

The current 'type' is typically stored in the domain record field (e.g. the `FlexType` field above).
The actual values are stored in the normal custom field location for <<Field Extensions>>.
The name of the value stored uses a prefix to avoid collisions with
the customer defined fields at the domain level.
In the example above, the `FlexType` field name is used (e.g. 'rmaType_address',
'rmaType_lastName', etc.).

See <<ExtensibleFieldHolder Annotation>> for details on the storage and internal format.
An example of the raw data stored in the database column is shown below.

[source,json]
.JSON Format Configurable Type Storage
----
{
  "rmaType_retailerID": "ACME-101",
  "rmaType_returnCode": "DEFECTIVE"
}
----


See <<Configurable Type API Access>> for details on accessing these fields.

==== GUI Marker Support

The framework markers that support these configurable types include:

* <<efEdit>>
* <<efCreate>>
* <<efShow>>
* <<efDefinitionList>>
* <<efField>>


==== Controller Support

The above markers use Javascript to dynamically build the input fields for a given configurable
type.  The
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/controller/BaseCrudController.html[BaseCrudController^]
icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] provides support for this.

==== Configurable Type API Access

Programmatic access to these values is provided by accessor methods based on the
`FlexType` field name (first letter uppercase shifted):

[source,groovy]
.Example Access to Configurable Type Values
----
  def rma = new RMA()
  rma.setRmaTypeValue('address','P.O. Box 8675309')

  . . .

  def lastName = rma.getRmaTypeValue('lastName')

----



The access to the configurable types via the <<API Formats>> is similar.
The field names are the same as described in <<Configurable Type Persistent Storage>> above.
An example of the JSON format for an RMA is shown below:

[source,json]
.JSON Format for Configurable Type Fields
----
{
  "rma": "R10102-23",
  "qty": 12.2,
  "rmaType_retailerID": "ACME-101",
  "rmaType_returnCode": "DEFECTIVE"
}
----

==== Configurable Types and POGOs

Configurable types such as <<Flex Types>> are normally used with domain classes, but they
can also be used with POGO classes.  This limits the <<Configurable Type API Access>> to
just these features:

* `setFieldValue()`
* `getFieldValue()`

This is designed to work with transfer objects that copy values between POGOs and domain objects.

For example, you might use this transfer POGO with the above RMA examples:

[source,groovy]
.Example - Flex Type With POGO
----
class RMAResponse {
  String rma
   . . .

  FlexType rmaType  <.>

  @Nullable
  @ExtensibleFieldHolder  <.>
  @MappedProperty(type = DataType.JSON)
  String fields
}

----
<.> The field `rmaType` will hold the reference to the appropriate flex type.  The actual
    values will be stored in the `fields` field as described
    in <<Configurable Type Persistent Storage>>.
<.> The FlexType requires a place to store the values for this POGO.
    This is done in the normal location for <<Field Extensions>>.


When you need to copy the values between this POGO and the domain, you will need to copy
both fields:

[source,groovy]
.Example - Copying Data - Flex Type With POGO
----
def rma = RMA.findByRma('RMA1')

def response = new RMAResponse()

response.qty = rma.qty
response.rmaType = rma.rmaType  <.>
response.fields = rma.fields

----
<.> You need to copy the flex type field and the values holder (typically `fields`).
