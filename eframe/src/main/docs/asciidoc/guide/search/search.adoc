=== Search Overview

Search is an important part of any modern web-based application.  This framework provides
built-in tools to index your domain classes and provide searching capabilities. The search
feature has these key requirements:

* Search all fields in a domain (used to find records in the standard list pages).
* Global text search of all fields on all domains.
* Search custom fields.
* Search archived records for long-term traceability features.
* An external search engine to allow scaling.
* No significant impact on application startup or test startup.

Because of these requirements, we decided to implement a custom integration with the
http://www.elastic.co/[Elastic Search] engine.  The framework uses the
http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/index.html[Elastic low-level Java API]
to reduce dependencies.  This should not cause problems with your application code
since this is hidden from the application level code.

The main features involved in search are:

* link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/search/service/SearchService.html[SearchService^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] -
    Provides ability to search one or more domains.  This is the main API access for most
    application code.
* link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/search/controller/SearchController.html[SearchController^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] -
    Provides a GUI for these features and access to admin actions such as re-index all.
* Domain search definitions - Defines how to index a domain.
* Automatic indexing of domains on update/create.

The basic index updates are made by background threads to reduce the affect on the run-time
application code. This background mechanism uses queues to allow multiple threads to request
index updates as needed.

==== Search Layers

The search logic is broken into layers.  Generally, most application code should start at
the service/helper layers and let the lower layers handle the details.  The layers and important
objects involved are:

The link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/search/service/SearchService.html[SearchService^]
icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] provide the important search method:

* `globalSearch()` - Searches all domains for the given string.  Structured Elastic Search
                     formats are supported.

If you need to unit test your application code, then refer to the existing search tests such as
_SearchHelperSpec_.  These tests use the _MockSearchEngineClient_ to simulate most search engine
actions.

==== Search Indexing

This framework's use of Elasticsearch is designed around a single index for each domain class and an
archive index for each archived domain class.  This provides a structured way to search for data
and still allows for a global search capability.

The search index name is the domain's class name (minus package), in lower-case with a hyphen
for a delimiter between words.  For example, the index for _FlexType_ is _'flex-type'_.

The archive index has _'-arc'_ added to it.  Also, archived domains have a special field added:
_'_archiveReference'_ that stores the archive file reference.



==== Search Paging

The paging mechanism for searches is slightly different from the normal Toolkit and database
paging mechanisms. This makes for confusing overlaps with the other paging values.
The paging names and meanings are shown below:

[cols="1,1,4",width=75%]
|===
|Feature |Field | Description

.2+|Search
|*from*
| The index of the first result to show.

|*size*
| The number of results to show.

.2+|GUI Toolkit
|*start*
| The index of the first result to show.

|*count*
| The number of results to show.

.2+|Micronaut Data (DB)
|*from*
| The _page_ number of the first result to show.

|*size*
| The number of results to show.

=== Search ID

Elastic search uses a unique ID for all objects indexed.  The enterprise framework uses the
domain class's UUID as this ID.  It is still stored internally in some data elements as __id_.




=== Search Configuration

Your search configuration is set in the _application.yml_ file as normal.
The default settings are shown below:

[source,yaml]
.application.yml - Default Settings
----
eframe:
  search:
    threadInitSize:  4    // <.>
    threadMaxSize: 10     // <.>
    bulkBatchSize: 50     // <.>
    hosts:
      - {host: localhost, port: 9200, protocol: http} // <.>

----
<.> *threadInitSize* - The initial thread pool size for the background tasks.
<.> *threadMaxSize* - The maximum thread pool size for the background tasks.
<.> *bulkBatchSize* - The size of the batch for bulk index requests.  Used when rebuilding all indices.
<.> *hosts*  - A list of search engine hosts that can process requests.

==== threadInitSize

The `threadInitSize` value is the initial number of threads created to handle background search
indexing requests. This should be fairly small for most cases.  (*Default:* 4).

==== threadMaxSize

The `threadMaxSize` value is the maximum number of threads created to handle background search
indexing requests. This should be no larger than your search engine server can handle.  If it
is too small, then request may back up in the queue and indexing will lag.  If it is too big,
then the search engine may slow down significantly. (*Default:* 10).

==== bulkBatchSize

The `bulkBatchSize` value max batch bulk re-index requests.  Used when rebuilding all indices.
This helps reduce the load on the search engine server when forcing a full index rebuild.
A larger value may be needed with extremely big databases, but it will increase the load on the
the search engine server.  (*Default:* 50).

If you set this to a very large value, then the each request will be large and may consume
too much memory. If too small, then this will generate a huge number of small requests to
process. The default is a good compromise.


==== hosts

These are the search engine servers that you will use. Only one is required for the search feature to work
correctly.  Multiples are supported.  No default is provided. (*Required*).

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
eframe:
  search:
    hosts:
      - {host: localhost, port: 9200, protocol: http} // <.>
      - {host: elastic, port: 9200, protocol: http}

----
<.> Multiple hosts can be defined.

This defines the servers to connect to for the external search engine.


==== Fallback

To speed testing and reduce setup time, you don't have to use a search engine.  Instead,
the places where the search engine is used will either be disabled or will fall back to
simpler SQL-based searches.

The standard definition List pages will use SQL searches on the primary key field.
Most other search features will be disabled.

The goal of the fallback is not to provide the entire set of search features. The goal is to
make sure you can test other aspects of your application without the overhead of an external
search engine. To make this even easier on you, the initial connection to the external search
engine is only made when it is first used.

=== Searchable Domains

By default, domains are not searchable.  You will need to add a static field to the domain class
to tell the framework that the domain is searchable.  The simplest approach is:

[source,groovy]
.Domain
----
static searchable = true
----

==== Index Options

When the domain object is indexed, there are other options.

[source,groovy]
.Searchable Options
----
static searchable = {
  exclude = ['title', 'releaseDate']
}
----

The following options are allowed in the searchable value:

* *exclude* - The field(s) to exclude.  These fields are excluded at all levels of the index.
              The value can be a single string or a list of strings. *(Optional)*


See link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/search/SearchDomainSettings.html[SearchDomainSettings^]
icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] for the specific settings that can be defined
for a domain.

==== Indices Created

Elastic Search 6.x and above have deprecated the use of an index type.  This means each domain
will be indexed into its own index with a type set to _doc_.  The name is the same as the domain
class (with initial lower case letter).  The domain _Order_ will be indexed under the index _order_.

==== Default Mapping

The default mapping is the same as for the <<api-formats>>.  This means child records will be indexed fully.
Foreign references to other domains will be indexed with only their key fields.  This means you can search for
domains that have a foreign reference to the FlexType _'SERIAL'_ and the global search will find them.

=== Query String Adjustments

The search engine is very versatile in finding data.  However, some of the query strings the user
must build can be very complex.  For example, the search term must match the entire term that
is indexed by the search engine.  This means if the object contains _'Monitor'_, then the search
string _'Mon'_ will not find the object.

Another more complex issue is when the data is deeply nested. To find a custom `LOT` value of
_'87929459'_ in an assembled order (the MES-Assembly module) the user needs to use the
query string:

  order.assembledComponents.assemblyDataValues.LOT:87929459

We want to use a simpler format:

  assy.lot:87929459

To make this possible, the MES-Assembly module will adjust the query string under the right
scenarios to find the data the user wants.


The framework adjusts the query string using the method
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/search/SearchService.html[SearchService.adjustQuery()^]
icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"].
This allows each module (see <<Module Additions>>) to adjust the string for its
own data structures.

Most adjustments happen only on simple query strings.  If the string contains a quote, then the
string is usually not adjusted.

The framework performs a simple adjustment that adds '\*' to the string if it does not have
a '*' in the string.  This allows partial searches to work easier.  This is only done if the
query string is simple.  If the string has a space, parentheses or other query logic then
the adjustment is not made.



=== Search Admin

The search admin page shows the current status of the external search engine and any background
tasks that pending (including a background index rebuild tasks).

image::guis/searchAdmin.png[title="Search Admin",align="center", width=750]

==== Rebuild Search Indices

The admin page displays a button to rebuild all search indices for the system.  This will:

. Ask the user: _Are you sure?_
. Delete all indices in the external search engine.
. Start rebuilding the indices for all searchable domain objects.
. Start rebuilding the indices for any archive files found in the file system.

Since these tasks can take a long time, they are executed in the background.  This admin page
will show the current status of the rebuild tasks.

The <<bulkBatchSize>> setting is used to build the bulk index requests.
Each request will contain this number of records (`batchSize`).  If you set this to a very large
value, then the each request will be large and may consume too much memory.  If too small,
then this will generate a huge number of small requests to process.  The default is a good
compromise.

=== Search Engine Request Queue

Whenever a searchable domain object is updated, a request is created to create/update the index
in the external search engine.  This can generate a huge amount of request on a heavily loaded
system. To avoid application slow-down, the framework implements a thread pool executor
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/search/SearchEnginePoolExecutor.html[SearchEnginePoolExecutor^]
icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] to handle these requests.  This executor also handles bulk
index requests and index delete requests.

This executor has an unlimited request queue and a finite number of threads to process these
requests. In practice, this means you should not need to worry too much about the queue.
The search admin page can give details on its status.
The number of threads to handle these requests is configurable in the application.yml.
See <<Search Configuration>> for details.

One of the drawbacks of using a queue is that it may take awhile for an updated record to be
indexed. This is not a big problem, but you should be aware of it.  In extreme cases when the
external search engine is not available, then errors will be logged and the indexing will not
take place.  A re-index all action is available.

As an application developer, the executor is mostly hidden from you. Most of the application
level actions should be triggered using the
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/search/SearchService.html[SearchService^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"].
Behind the scenes, a _SearchHelper_ and a _SearchEngineClient_ class handles the actual interface
work.  You should not need to use those levels of access.



=== Troubleshooting Search Issues

Search is a complex subject.  Adding in the external search engine server makes troubleshooting
a difficult task.  To determine what is happening inside of the search logic, you can enable
TRACE logging on the package _org.simplemes.eframe.search_.  This will print performance data
and all inputs and outputs used when talking to the search engine server.
