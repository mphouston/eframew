==== Hibernate Error HHH020003

On startup, you see a warning like this:

----
WARN  o.h.c.e.AbstractEhcacheRegionFactory - HHH020003: Could not find a specific ehcache configuration for cache named [XYZ]; using defaults.
----

This is caused by a missing cache setting in the _ehcache.xml_ file.  See <<Hibernate>> for details.
