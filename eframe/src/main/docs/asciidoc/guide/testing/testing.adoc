Automated testing of your application is critical to your success.
The Enterprise Framework module helps you test your application with test support helpers.

=== Testing Philosophy

Our applications use the unit tests to test as much code as possible.
These can be 'true' unit tests or more like integration tests.
This is done for speed purposes.

GUI tests end with '_GUISpec_'.  These typically trigger an embedded server startup.
Some tests will test domains, which will start the data store for testing the full
domain stack.
