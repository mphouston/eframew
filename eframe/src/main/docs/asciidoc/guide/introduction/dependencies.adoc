You do not have to include these in your _build.gradle_ file.  This framework depends on these
modules and the build system will include them in your application.

NOTE: If you include these in your _build.gradle_ file, then you must make sure the versions are
consistent with the versions this framework requires. The specific versions needed are listed in
the framework's _build.gradle_ file.
