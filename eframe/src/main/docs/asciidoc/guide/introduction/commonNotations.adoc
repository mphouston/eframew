=== Common Notations

This is a complex framework.  We want to define specific notations used to indicates issues in the
code and the application behaviors.

==== Note

This indicates something be beware of.  This is frequently used to flag things that may become an
issue someday.  We want these flagged in a standard way to easily identify possible source of
problems when a library module is upgraded.  This includes some highlighting in the JavaDoc.

For example:

[source,groovy]
.Note Example - Groovy Code
----
  /**
   * Returns all of the domain classes defined in the system.
   * <p>
   * <b>Note:</b> This method uses the internal values of the Micronaut.  // <1>
                  This may change someday.
   * @return
   */
  List<Class> getAllDomains() {
    . . .
  }
----
<1> Flags something that may change in future releases of modules this code depends on.
