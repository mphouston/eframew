There are a number of programming and design standards that the framework follows to give you a consistent
API to work with. These conventions help the framework work with your application with minimal
coding on your part. These standards are described here.

[[class-method-design,Class/Method Design (Fluid API)]]
==== Class/Method Design (Fluid API)

There is a programming concept called 'Fluid API' that makes a lot of sense.  This approach is needed
when more than 2 values need to be passed to a method/class.  After 2 values, the meaning of each
value is not always obvious without a good IDE.
For example:

[source,groovy]
----
new NumberField('lotSize', 12.3, 1.0, 45.0)
----

In this example, it is not clear what each number is doing.
To avoid this problem, the framework generally uses the Groovy map constructor approach:

[source,groovy]
----
new NumberField(name: 'lotSize',
                defaultValue: 12.3,
                minValue: 1.0,
                maxValue: 45.0)
----

This make it very clear what each number is and Groovy enforces basic types and naming with the default Map constructor.

Groovy generally creates this constructor for you, but you can create your own.
When you need to define your own constructor, you can use this code to emulate the Groovy Map constructor logic:

[source,groovy]
----
NumberField(Map options) {
  // Copy all options to the right field.
  options?.each { k, v ->
    this[k as String] = v
  }
}
----

==== Current User

You will frequently need to log records with the user who performed some action.  The obvious
solution is to add a `User` to the domain and just store a reference to the user in database.
This is simple, but it does have one big drawback:  The referential integrity constraints
in the database makes it difficult to remove user records.

To increase database flexibility, we will use the user name itself for these types of logging actions.
This also reduces the chance of accidentally exporting the user/password info in a generic JSON
export. This is important for archiving since we don't want to archive the user
records or force re-creation of deleted user records when un-archiving.

An example domain record below will record the user name for a component that has been
assembled:

[source,groovy]
.Example User Name Recording
----
class OrderComponent {
  . . .

  @Column(length = FieldSizes.MAX_CODE_LENGTH, nullable = false)
  String userName = SecurityUtils.currentUserName  // <1>
  Date dateTime

----
<1> The user who is currently logged into the session for this request.

This reduces the code since the default for the new component is the current user.  No
extra database access is needed.

In contrast, the logic needed to store a full reference to the User object would be slower and
more complex.


==== ENUMs

The normal Java style enums can be used in your application.
These enums are displayed in the
standard GUIs as a drop-down list with the enums `toStringLocalized(Locale)` text as the displayed
value for each valid value.

Your enum should have these fields/methods to support storage in the database and display of human-readable
values for each enum:

* `id` - The database representation of this enum.  Typically 1 character. *(Required)*
* `toStringLocalized(Locale)` - The display value for this enum.  Optionally localized.  Used
   by Jackson for JSON creation.
   If not implemented, then normal `toString()` method will be used.

The localization can use any .properties file entry you like, but the standard approach is to use
a naming convention like this (for a time interval enumeration):


[source,groovy]
----
reportTimeInterval.CUSTOM_RANGE.label=Custom Range
reportTimeInterval.LAST_24_HOURS.label=Last 24 Hours
reportTimeInterval.LAST_7_DAYS.label=Last 7 Days
reportTimeInterval.LAST_30_DAYS.label=Last 30 Days
reportTimeInterval.LAST_6_MONTHS.label=Last 6 Months
reportTimeInterval.LAST_MONTH.label=Last Month
reportTimeInterval.LAST_YEAR.label=Last Year
reportTimeInterval.THIS_MONTH.label=This Month
reportTimeInterval.THIS_YEAR.label=This Year
reportTimeInterval.TODAY.label=Today
reportTimeInterval.YESTERDAY.label=Yesterday
----

An example `toStringLocalized(Locale)` method looks like this:

[source,groovy]
----
public String toStringLocalized(Locale locale=null) {
  return GlobalUtils.lookup("reportTimeInterval.${name()}.label",locale)
}
----

When the enums list of valid values is shown in list (e.g. a drop-down list in a GUI),
then the list of valid values is displayed in the default Java order.  This is the order
that the enum values are defined in the class.  This means
you should put the most common values first in your enum .groovy file.

==== Exceptions

When it is time to throw an exception, you have to decide what type of exception to throw.
In most cases, it comes down to how important the message is when monitoring a live system.
What exceptions should show up in the server log (main log or StackTrace.log)?
The framework follows a simple rule: If an exception is a
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/exception/BusinessException.html[BusinessException^]
icon:share-square[role="link-blue"], then it won't show up in the log files.
These type of exceptions are usually returned to the caller or displayed in the GUI.

This means most business logic should throw a _BusinessException_ when the problem is not a
system type problem. This means most errors that should be fixed by the caller will be
BusinessExceptions.

More critical exceptions are thrown with the
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/exception/MessageBasedException.html[MessageBasedException^]
icon:share-square[role="link-blue"].  These exceptions are logged.


==== Error Codes

The link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/exception/BusinessException.html[BusinessException^]
icon:share-square[role="link-blue"] uses an error code to define specific errors.
The error ranges are allocated to the modules as follows:

[cols="1,5", width="70%"]
|===
|Range|Use

|0-1999     |  Reserved codes for framework messages.  Usually MessageBasedException's.
|2000-9999  |  MES Application messages.
|10000-10999| Assembly module errors.
|11000-11999| Defect Tracking module.
|50000-     |     Customization messages.
|===


==== Info/Warning Messages to Clients

In enterprise apps, it is quite common to display information and warning messages to the user.
In an HTTP request/response world, it is difficult returning multiple messages from multiple
levels in a method call hierarchy.  We solve this by allowing your code to accumulate
messages in a
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/exception/MessageHolder.html[MessageHolder^]
icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] that is shared by all methods in the current thread.
This is done using the ServerRequestContext.currentRequest to store the messages as a request
attribute.

The controller will then use these messages in building its response.

The MessageHolder supports multiple messages with levels of severity.  It also provides
methods to store the messages in the current HTTP request as an attribute.

An example set of messages will look like this in JSON:

[source,json]
----
{
  "message": {
   "level": "warn",
   "text": "Order 'M1657334' is not enabled",
   "otherMessages": [
     "message": {
      "level": "info",
      "text": "Order 'M1657334' is marked urgent",
     }
   ]
  }
}
----

The standard clients will usually display all of the messages with proper styling (color/icon)
in a standard message area (near the top of the page/panel).


==== Static Methods

Many utility classes in the framework are simple calculations that really do not need the
full Micronaut bean support.  Instead, we have built them with a simple static Singleton
instance to access the utility method.
See link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/controller/ControllerUtils.html[ControllerUtils^]
icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] for an example:


[source,groovy]
.Static Instance Method Access
----
def (offset, max) = ControllerUtils.instance.calculateSortingForList(params)
----


This singleton approach allows easier mocking of these methods without the overhead of making
them full-fledged beans.

NOTE: A few of these utility methods may still use a true static method approach (no need for
      calling them via the _.instance_ variable).  These are done in frequently called
      areas (e.g. link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/misc/ArgumentUtils.html[ArgumentUtils^]
      icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]).  There are no plans to convert them to use
      the _.instance_ approach.

The general rule: if any method in the *Utils class needs to be mocked easily, then the whole
class should use the _.instance_ approach.

==== ASCIIDoctor Standards

The ASCIIDoctor library is the source for documents such as this Guide.  It has a few quirks that
you need to be aware of when creating _.adoc_ files.

===== Image Widths

The `image` tag has a `width` option.  You should not use a percentage since the PDF images will
will interpret this as pixels, not percent.  This will make a very small image.

[source,asciidoc]
.Example - ASCII Doctor Image Width
----
image::guis/DashboardWorkList.png[Dashboard - Work List,align="center",width="600"] // <.>

----
<.> The width should be in pixels.  600 is typically a good value for 60% of the width.
