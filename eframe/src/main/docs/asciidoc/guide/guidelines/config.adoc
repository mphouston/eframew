=== Configuration

Micronaut and this framework have many configuration options defined at the application level.
Your application needs to use a number of these settings to take full advantage of the
enterprise framework.


==== application.yml

ifeval::["{backend}" != "pdf"]
[inline-toc]#<<build-gradle>>#
endif::[]



The _application.yml_ file controls many of the features of your application.
To avoid issues with the framework, you should use these settings:



==== build.gradle

See <<dependencies>> for details on the changes needed in _build.gradle_ for required plugins.
