=== GUI Configuration

Many elements support easy user-level configuration.  For example, the user
(with permissions) can re-configure a <<Dashboards>> in a user-friendly configuration editor.
To reduce the screen clutter, there is a 'master' configuration button in the upper right-hand
corner that enables the configuration buttons on all configurable elements in the GUI.
The sequence of events to edit a dashboard is shown below:

This provides easy access to the configuration GUI without cluttering the display with too many
configuration button. The configuration button is available on the following elements:

* Tables (TBD)
* <<Dashboards>>
* <<Definition Pages>>
