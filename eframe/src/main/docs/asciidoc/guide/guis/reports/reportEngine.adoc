==== Report Engine


The third-party report engine is provided by the open-source
https://community.jaspersoft.com/[Jasper Reports^] library.  This report engine can generate
reports from user-designed reports created in an interactive report designer.   The enterprise framework
can use the report definitions (.jrxml files) to generate report output in the browser
and for printing.

These report support HTML and PDF formats.  The HTML formats also provide a filter panel at the
top to display the parameters used for the report and to allow the user to change the
filter values.

The report engine uses the .jrxml file format for the reports produced by its designer studio.
There are a few guidelines that you must follow to make some features work.  For example, there
is a specific way to specify the location of images that will work with reports in HTML and
PDF formats.


====== Report Parameter BaseDir

There is an important report parameter that is used to find the location of images and
hyper-linked reports.  This is the `BaseDir` parameter.   This parameter must be defined
as:

* Is For Prompting  - *False*
* Class - *String*
* Evaluation Time - *Early*

These settings make the `BaseDir` available for things like image locations and
hyperlinks (see below).

NOTE: If `Is For Prompting` is set wrong, then the value won't be set at run-time.
      This means the report may not create image links and hyperlinks correctly.

====== Report Permissions

Reports can sometimes contain sensitive information.   To make sure data is not viewed
by unauthorized people, you can define additional permissions needed to view the report.

By default, all reports are viewable by all users.  To restrict a report, you can define
a custom property in the report to limit the report to users with the given role(s).

In the report designer studio, you can add a custom property by viewing the report properties
and under 'Misc', click on the Edit Properties '...' dialog.  This dialog allows you to create
a string property:

  org.simplemes.roles  ADMIN,SUPERVISOR

This will allow any user with the ADMIN and SUPERVISOR to view the report.


====== Report Conventions

To enable some of the framework features such as filter criteria, you should follow some simple
conventions in your report in the designer:


* *Reports Folders must be simple text.*
+
The folders should not have hyphen (-) or underscore (-).  For example:
+
----
reports/
  eframe/
  core/
  assy/
  app/
----

* *Report Name Starts with Domain Name.*
+
When possible, the report name should start with the core domain object that the report
displays.  This is used in the optional <<Report Filter Panel>> created at the top of the report.
This also helps identify which domain object forms the core of the report.

* *Report Name for Task Menu Define in _messages.properties_*.
+
The report name is also used in building the entry for the main <<Task Menu>>.
This allows you to define locale-specific menus/tooltips in the task menu
for built-in reports.
+
For example, the report _ArchiveLog.jrxml_ can use these _messages.properties_ entries:
+
----
taskMenu.ArchiveLog.label=Archive Log Report
taskMenu.ArchiveLog.tooltip=Archive Log Report
----
+
If the labels do not exist in the _messages.properties_ file, then the file name
(e.g. ArchiveLog) will be used for the menu and tooltip.


* *Parameter Name Matches Field*
+
<<Report Parameters>> are used with many reports to help filter the report to the specific
records the user is interested in.  The framework provides a way for the user to change them
and re-run the report.  The framework can use the standard input fields to be consistent with
the application.
+
If the parameter name matches a field in the domain object, then the framework will the input widgets
for that field when needed. This includes use of enumeration drop-downs for filtering and
date/time fields.
+
For example, the report _ArchiveLog.jrxml_ might use the `className` parameter to provide a
string input field with the correct labels in the <<Report Filter Panel>>.


* *Date Ranges*
+
Many reports use date ranges to filter their output.  These are implemented as <<Report Parameters>>
with specific names:
+
----
reportTimeInterval
startDate/endDate
   or
startDateTime/endDateTime
----
+
The framework will provide filter fields with drop-downs to help the user select the right date/time
range.
+
The report will use the `reportTimeInterval` as a enum drop-down to select a generic date/time range
(e.g. today, this week, etc).  If the interval is _'CUSTOM_RANGE'_, then the date/time range
logic will let the user select a start and end date in the filter panel.
+
If the `reportTimeInterval` is used, then the start and end date/times will be supressed in the
filter panel.  These values are ignored by the report logic.
+
Other parameter names may be used, but the special date range drop-downs will not be generated.
In that case, simple date/time input fields will be used.


====== ReportUtils

Reports will sometimes need to use code in your application to handle complex tasks like
formatting <<Field Extensions>>.  This is typically handle by utility classes such as
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/reports/ReportUtils.html[ReportUtils^]
icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"].

This requires use of the framework _java8-supp.jar_ file as described in <<Designer Studio Setup>>.
This is a special .jar file that works with the Java 8 studio.


===== Built-in Reports

Most <<Module Additions>> will provide built-in reports specific to the module.  These reports
are delivered in the framework module in the _src/resources/reports_ folder.  These reports are
automatically added to the standard main <<Task Menu>> and can be executed by the users.

NOTE: The built-in reports should have unique file names to avoid conflicts with other
      modules.  


===== Add-on Reports

Your users will want to create/modify their own reports.  This is typically done in the
report designer studio and saved as a .jrxml file.
To make these reports available, you will need to combine these reports into a .jar file,
with the reports under the _'reports/'_ folder.  Then, you must add this .jar file
to the run-time class path.

WARNING: Do not add a simple folder to the production class path.  This is a huge
         potential security hole.  Doing this for test/development is sometime Ok.
         Use caution.

====== Image Locations

Images can be used in your reports.  You will need to specify the image location relative to
a `BaseDir` parameter in the images properties field:

  $P{BaseDir}+"/coffee.jpg"
  $P{BaseDir}+"/images/background.png"

This `BaseDir` will be set at run-time to the location of jrxml file.  This allows you to refer
to images as as relative location.
See <<Report Parameter BaseDir>> for details on the `BaseDir` parameter.

====== Drill-Down Hyperlinks

One great feature of most reporting tools is the ability to drill down into detail reports
from a high-level report.  The report engine interface allows you to create hyperlinks to other
reports.

First, select the field you want to be a hyperlink in the report designer.  Then set the designer
property `HyperLink Reference Expression` to a value like:

  "loc="+$P{BaseDir}+"/ReportChild.jrxml&className="+$F{class_name}

Also, you will need to set the Hyperlink `Link Type` value to 'Custom'.
This creates a link to the _ReportChild.jrxml_ report, passing the `className` as a parameter
for the report.

These hyperlinks can be used in tabular reports and as links in charts.
This is done in the designer studio in the 'Hyperlink' properties tab of the tabular column or the
chart's Data set element.

See <<Report Parameter BaseDir>> for details on the `BaseDir` parameter.

====== Hyperlink Triggers URL URISyntaxException

You will probably create semi-static hyperlinks in your reports.  If these hyperlinks have
un-escaped SQL wild-cards (%), then you will get an exception when you click it:

  java.net.URISyntaxException: Malformed escape pair at index 59:

This happens when you create a hyperlink like this:

  /report?loc=reports/detail/ProductionTabular.jrxml&product=%&startDateTime=2020-01-01T05:00:00.000Z

The problem is with the _product=%_ in the URL.  This is an un-escaped percent character.

You will have to change the link generation in the designer studio.  In the 'Hyperlink' properties settings
for the link _TextField_, you will need to encode the '%' in the _'Hyperlink Reference Expression'_
property like this:

[source,java]
.Example - Hyperlink URL Encoded
----
  "loc="+$P{BaseDir}+"/detail/ProductionTabular.jrxml&product="+
       java.net.URLEncoder.encode($P{product},"UTF-8")+   // <.>
       "&startDateTime="+ org.simplemes.eframe.date.ISODate.format($P{startDateTime})+
       "&endDateTime="+org.simplemes.eframe.date.ISODate.format($P{endDateTime})+
       "&reportRimeInterval="+$P{reportTimeInterval}

----
<.> This encoding is needed to avoid the error, if the _$P{product}_ can contain '%'.



===== Report Filter Panel

If the report has any report parameters that are flagged as 'isForPrompting', then the
HTML page will have a simple filter panel at the top of the report.  This panel will
show the current filter values (parameters) and allow the user to change the values.

This panel also has the ability to change output formats (e.g. to PDF).


===== Report Parameters

Most reports will need some sort of way to enter filter criteria for the report.  This can be a
simple field, a drop-down or a complex date range.  You will need to design your report queries to
use the parameters and to define the parameters as 'isForPrompting'.  See the report engine
design studio for details on setting these properties.
The framework will build the page with the report parameters listed at the top, with options to
change them.


====== Parameter Default Values

It is best to define default values for the parameters in teh report designer.  This allows the
framework to automatically fill in the data and display the report.  The framework will remember
the user's last filter/search parameter values.  This will reduce the number of clicks needed
for common/repeated reports.

If all input parameters have default values, then the report will be automatically
generated.

====== Parameter Display Sequence

Many reports will have multiple parameters.  It is sometimes important to have a consistent
display order for the user.  You can control this in the report designer by adding a custom property
to the parameter:

  sequence

This property is treated as the display order for the field. If no sequence is set on a field, then the
sequence is assigned as:


* reportTimeInterval - sequence = 100
* startDateTime - sequence = 110
* endDateTime - sequence = 120
* all others - sequence = 50

This default numbering scheme will make the reportTimeInterval and its date fields display in
a consistent order.

====== Parameter Provided on URL

It is also possible to pass these parameters on the URL for the report.  This allows you to define
common reports a links/bookmarks.  For the ArchiveLog report, the URL will look like this:

  http://host/report?loc=reports/ArchiveLog.jrxml&className=sample.Order

This will set the `className` report parameter to 'sample.Order' for the report display.



===== Report Localization

Most reports should display localized text.  To do this, you will frequently use text fields
*(not static text)* to display values looked up from a properties file.  This is done with
the text value such as _$R{report.ArchiveLog.title}_.  This will find the text in the report's
properties file.  For example, the _eframe_labels.properties_ file might look like this:

  report.ArchiveLog.title = Archive Log Report
  report.ArchiveLog.subTitle = Archive Log Report

To make this work, you need to create the above file in the reports directory with the correct
bundle name (e.g. _eframe_labels.properties_).  Then you will need to reference this bundle
in your report.  You will specify the resource bundle name (just _eframe_labels_) in the report
designer for the top-level report element (e.g. _ArchiveLog.jrxml_).

You will then need to make sure the report (jrxml) and properties file are in the _reports/_ directory.
The ReportEngine logic will use this bundle  in the _reports/_ directory at runtime to find the
correct properties.  These values will be localized with the request's locale.


===== Report Row Limits

Reports can be a huge performance drain on your application.  To reduce the chance of this happening,
we limit the number of rows returned in reports to 1000 by default.  This reduces the chance of out
of memory errors on huge report data sets.

You can adjust this limit in the _applications.yml_ file:

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
eframe.report.rowLimit = 1000 <.>
----
<.> The default row limit for reports generated by the report engine.

NOTE: There is *NO* absolute `maxRowLimit` used by the report engine.  Since the row limit is
      NOT supported in the HTTP request parameters for reports.  There is no way for malicious code
      to set this row limit to huge value from the HTTP request.


===== Sub Reports

The external report engine supports the concept of sub-reports.   These are reports embedded
inside of a master report.  To support this, you will need to follow a specific naming convention
for the sub-report definition.

The sub-report itself should follow the normal conventions for images and hyperlinks.
In the master report, you will need to define a parameter that starts with the prefix
_SubReport_.  For example:


[cols="2,4"]
|===
|Field|Value

|*Parameter Name:* |SubReportComponents
|*Class:* |java.lang.Object
|*Default Value Expression:* |$P{BaseDir}+"/ComponentSubReport.jrxml"
|===


In the master report, you will add the sub-report to the right section (e.g. the detail section)
and define the sub-report with this 'Expression':

  P${SubReportComponents}

This will be changed at run-time to the specific report from the parameter.


You will also need to link up the resource bundle parameters from the parent to the sub-report.
This is done in the main report's sub-report section.  You select the sub-report and in the
properties designer, click the 'Edit Parameters' button.  This opens the 'SubReport Parameters'
dialog.  You will need to 'Add' a new parameter and link _REPORT_RESOURCE_BUNDLE_ from the main
report to _$P{REPORT_RESOURCE_BUNDLE}_ in the sub-report:

====== JRException: Resource not found at (some .jrxml file)

The designer studio is a very flexible tool for creating _.jrxml_ files, but it is complex.
The goal is to produce a _.jrxml_ file that can be used in the run-time simplemes server.
This introduces some gotchas to be aware of:

   Resource not found at: C:\Users\mph\JaspersoftWorkspace\MyReports\simplemes\app/_OrderHistoryComponents.jrxml.

This happens because the _.jrxml_ file has not be compiled into a _.jasper_ file.  You need to
run the 'Build All' (Ctrl+B on Windows) action from the studio toolbar.

The studio uses these_.jasper_ files for sub-reports when using the preview feature.



===== Designer Studio Setup

The report engine has an open-source designer studio that you can use to create these reports.
There are few setup guidelines, but if you need to use library methods from the framework,
you will need to use the framework classes added to the designer studio's classpath.  This is
easy to do.

. Right-click on the top level element in the Project Explorer (typically _MyReports_).
. Select _Properties_.
. In the Properties dialog, select the _Java Build Path_ property.
. Add a JAR file for the _java8-supp.jar_ module from the project build folder
  on your system. 
. Restart the Studio.
  
image::guis/ReportStudioClassPath.png[title="ReportStudioClassPath",align="center", width=750]

This will make some useful classes available for your reports.  These _java8-supp.jar_ file
classes are stub classes that simulate the real code's run-time behavior.  In a production
server, the real classes will be used by the report engine.
