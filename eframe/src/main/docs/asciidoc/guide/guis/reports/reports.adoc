The enterprise framework supports a third-party report engine for most report type pages.
The third-party report engine is used for simple to complex
reports.  It provides features such as barcodes and printer support.

Most reports have limited filtering capability.  This makes the implementation and
the GUI much simpler. If additional filtering, or other features are needed, then you can create
custom versions of these reports.
