==== efShow

The link:reference.html#efshow[efShow^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] marker
is used to build a <<definition-pages,definition GUI>> that displays a single domain object.
This shows all of the configured fields and provides menus to edit and delete the record.

NOTE: The last used tab panel is saved in the browser's local storage.  This is done
      because the user may switch tabs frequently and we do not want to overload the
      server with updates on each tab switch.
