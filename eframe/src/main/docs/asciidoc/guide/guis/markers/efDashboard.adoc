The
link:reference.html#efdashboard[efDashboard^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] marker is used to
display the configurable dashboard for user interaction. A dashboard is an instrument panel
that gives your users information and allows them to control some parts of your
application.  Typically, this dashboard allows configuration so that your customers can
tailor the display and behavior to their needs.  See <<Dashboards>> for an overview.

The enterprise framework provides a core dashboard mechanism that lets you provide those
features to your customers.  This dashboard uses small building blocks called 'activities' to
make up elements of this dashboard.  You provide core activities to your customers who combine
them into usable dashboard for their users.
