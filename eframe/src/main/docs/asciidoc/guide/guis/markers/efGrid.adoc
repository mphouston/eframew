==== efGrid

The link:reference.html#efgrid[efGrid^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] marker
is used to build a stand-alone list (grid) with values supplied by the server or
locally in the javascript.
By default, the row values are found by a controller `list()` method using json format.
This can be used to display domain classes or display any arbitrary POGO classes.

See <<pagination-filtering-and-sorting>> for details on the paging mechanism.

.efGrid Example - List Available Work (WorkListController)
----
<@efGrid columns="order,lsn,qtyInQueue,qtyInWork"/>
----

This works with the controller that is rendering the page to supply the values for display.
By default, the grid will use the controller's `list()` method to get the list of value to display.

An example grid is shown below:
