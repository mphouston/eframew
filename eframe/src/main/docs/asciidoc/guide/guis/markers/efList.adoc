==== efList

The link:reference.html#eflist[efList^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] marker
is used to build a pageable GUI grid with one or more columns of data.
By default, the row values are found by a controller `list()` method using the json format
with toolkit-style controller parameters.
This can be used to display domain classes or display any arbitrary POGO classes.

See <<pagination-filtering-and-sorting>> for details on the paging mechanism.

<@efList columns="userName,title,enabled..."/>

This works well with domain classes that have key fields defined.  If it is linked to a
controller for a domain class, then it is assumed to be a standard definition list.
This means the 'Create' button will be displayed and linked to the standard create page.

An example list is shown below:
