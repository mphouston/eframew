==== efList

The link:reference.html#eflist[efList^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] marker
is used to build a stand-alone list with values supplied by the server or
locally in the javascript.
By default, the row values are found by a controller `list()` method using json format.
This can be used to display domain classes or display any arbitrary POGO classes.

See <<pagination-filtering-and-sorting>> for details on the paging mechanism.

.efList Example - List Available Work (WorkListController)
----
<@efForm id="show" dashboard=true>  // <.>
  <@efList columns="order,lsn,qtyInQueue,qtyInWork"/>  // <.>
</@efForm>
----
<.> This list is rendered as if was a field in the given form.  This variant is suitable
    for use in one of the <<Dashboard Activities>>.
<.> Will display values from the current controller using data from the `list()` method.

This works with the controller that is rendering the page to supply the values for display.
By default, the list will use the controller's `list()` method to get the list of value to display.

NOTE: This marker must be used inside of a <<efForm>> marker.

An example list is shown below:
