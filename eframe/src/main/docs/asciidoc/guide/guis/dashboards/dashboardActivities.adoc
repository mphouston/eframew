The dashboard is a general-purpose mechanism used to display activities (pages) that let your
users interact with your application. These activities are specialized HTML pages that use the
<<Dashboard API>> to interact with the dashboard and perform actions for your users.  These
activities can have a GUI, no GUI or a GUI that is only displayed when you have to ask
the user for input.

NOTE: These activities are not full-blown HTML pages.  They are displayed within a splitter panel in
      the dashboard, so the standard form submission is not allowed.
      See <<Form Submission (Ajax)>> for details.



You create these activities much like any other page, with a controller method
and a .FTL page:

[source,groovy]
.Example - Controller Activity Method - Start
----
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Post("/start")
HttpResponse start(HttpRequest request, @Nullable Principal principal) {
  def startRequest = Holders.objectMapper.readValue(request.body.get(), StartRequest)
  def service = Holders.applicationContext.getBean(WorkService)
  def res = service.start(startRequest)
  return HttpResponse.status(HttpStatus.OK).body(Holders.objectMapper.writeValueAsString(res))
}
----

[source,html]
.Example - FTL Page for a Dashboard Activity
----
<script>
  <@efForm id="logFailure" dashboard="buttonHolder">  // <.>
    <@efField field="rma" value="RMA1001" width=20/>
    <@efField field="product" value="CM3056857"/>
    <@efButtonGroup>
      <@efButton label="Log Failure"   // <.>
        click="dashboard.postActivity('logFailure','/test/dashboard/log','${params._panel}');"/> // <.>
      <@efButton label="cancel.label" click="dashboard.finished('${params._panel}')"/>  // <.>
    </@efButtonGroup>
  </@efForm>
</script>


----
<.> A simple form for the dashboard.
<.> A button that will post the form to a URI.
<.> Use of unique `${params._panel}` to make avoid <<Activity Variable Collisions>>.
<.> A cancel button that dismisses the activity and re-displays the next activity in the panel.


This simple example allows the page to be displayed, and respond to user actions.
The logic will notify the dashboard that it is finished.
See the <<reference.adoc#dashboard-js,Dashboard JS>> for details on what your activities can do.

NOTE: It is a good practice to use the `params._panel` parameter on all functions, variables and
      HTML IDs in your activity pages. This avoid collisions (see below).

Your dashboard activity pages are passed a small number of HTTP parameters that you will need
to interact with the dashboard itself:

[cols="1,1,4"]
|===
|Parameter|Type|Description

|_panel|String|The panel (name) this activity is displayed in.  This is needed for some of the javascript API methods.
|_variable|String|The name of a Javascript variable that you can use to define the
                  the elements to be displayed or define functions executed by your code.
                  Normally, the display element is created by the <<efForm>> marker.
|===

NOTE: Any parameters from the dashboard URL will be passed to each activity displayed.  Typically,
      this is used to default field values for your users.

===== Activity URI/URL

The activities are access by their uri/url.  These only really allow two basic formats:

[cols="1,1,4"]
|=== 
|Format|Example|Effective URL

|Relative|/order/scrap|/order/scrap
|Absolute|http://server:port/order/scrap|http://server:port/order/scrap
|=== 

The absolute format is subject to the normal cross-site restrictions in the browser.

There is no short form relative (e.g. just 'action') since the enclosing controller is typically
the framework Dashboard controller.  This is not too useful for most application.


===== Form Submission (Ajax)

These dashboard activities are not full-blown web pages.  They are a fragment of a page that
is displayed within a panel in the dashboard.
This means you can't use the normal HTML form submission mechanism. Instead, you will need to use
the <<reference.adoc#postactivity,postActivity()>> convenience function to post the inputs.
This will convert the standard form to a JSON payload and POST it to a URL.  The page will not
be refreshed.
This function also handles the standard message <<reference.adoc#responses,Responses>> and
support for <<Undo>>.

===== Activity Variable Collisions

Since the activities are all displayed in a single web page, you have to be careful with naming of
HTML elements and javascript entities.  Variables and functions can collide if there are duplicate
values on the page.  To avoid this, you should use the `_panel` or `_variable` parameter to make
unique names on the page.

[source,html]
.Example - Avoid Javascript Name Collisions
----
<script>
  ${params._variable}.done =  function() {  // <.>
    dashboard.postActivity('logFailure','/test/dashboard/log','${params._panel}');
    ef.displaymessage({info: 'Finished.});
  }
  <@efForm id="logFailure" dashboard="buttonHolder">
    <@efField field="rma" value="RMA1001" width=20/>
    <@efButtonGroup>
      <@efButton label="Log Failure"
        click="${params._variable}.done()"/>  // <.>
    </@efButtonGroup>
  </@efForm>
</script>
----
<.> Defines the a function stored in the `_variable` for use by the dialog.
<.> Calls the function.  If on Panel 'B', then the function will be `_B.done()`.


[[dashboard-activity-non-gui,Activities with Limited GUIs]]
===== Activities with Limited GUIs

In some cases, a dashboard activity will trigger a request with no GUI when a dashboard button
is pressed. These typically do not need a GUI to perform their task.
To optimize this scenario, the dashboard logic will detect a non-GUI activity
and handle it differently.  In this scenario, the page will contain no display element.  Instead of
displaying a page in a panel, the Javascript will be evaluated without a change to the panel display.
When this Javascript finishes, the dashboard will remove the Javascript from the page.

These non-GUI activities can have these capabilities:

* Execute Ajax call(s) to perform the actions.
* Ask questions in a dialog.
* Handle requests from the server (<<Asking Questions>>).
* Display messages for the Dashboard.

This non-GUI flow is shown below:

image::models/Non-GUIDashboardActivity.png[Non-GUIDashboardActivity,align="center"]

The user presses a configured button in the dashboard.  This button triggers an activity that has
no GUI elements.  It has just a single `<script>` tag.  The dashboard evaluates this script in the
appropriate panel.  When the script codes finishes, it must call the standard
dashboard <<dashboard-finished>> method.  The dashboard then removes the
Javascript methods from the browser.

See <<Non-GUI Activity>> example below for details on how you can use this feature.


===== Debugging Dashboard Activities

Debugging complex activity interaction in a dashboard can be difficult.  To make this a little
easier, you can use the <<Javascript Client Logging>> features.  This means setting these logging
levels to _TRACE_ or _DEBUG_:

  client.dashboard
  client.to-server

This log events, and executions of activities to the console (and optionally to the server).

==== Activity Examples


===== GUI Activity

Dashboard activities can have a GUI that allows the user to enter data.  These tend to work with a
controller method to process the inputs and show the results.  A simple RMA controller is shown below:

[source,groovy]
.Example - Dashboard Activity with Input Fields - Controller
----
@Get("/rma")
@View("sample/dashboard/rma")
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_HTML)
StandardModelAndView index(@Nullable Principal principal) { // <.>
  def modelAndView = new StandardModelAndView("sample/dashboard/rma", principal, this)
  Map model = (Map) modelAndView.model.get()
  return modelAndView
}

@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Post("/rma")
HttpResponse rma(HttpRequest request, @Nullable Principal principal) {  // <.>
  def rmaRequest = Holders.objectMapper.readValue(request.body.get(), RMARequest)
  def service = Holders.applicationContext.getBean(RMAService)
  def res = service.createRMA(rmaRequest)
  return HttpResponse.status(HttpStatus.OK).body(Holders.objectMapper.writeValueAsString(res))
}

----
<.> Provides the display page for the _rma.ftl_ file.
<.> Creates the RMA using the service _RMAService_. Uses the Micronaut application context to
    find the bean.  Returns a response in JSON format.


[source,html]
.Example - Dashboard Activity with Input Fields - View rma.ftl
----
<script>
  <#assign panel = "${params._panel}"/>  // <.>
  <#assign variable = "${params._variable}"/>

  <@efForm id="logFailure" dashboard="buttonHolder">  // <.>
    <@efField field="serial" value="RMA1001" width=20/>  // <.>
    <@efField field="customer" value="ACME_101"/>
    <@efButtonGroup>
      <@efButton label="RMA"  // <.>
                 click="dashboard.postActivity('logFailure','/test/dashboard/rma','${panel}');"/>
      <@efButton label="cancel.label" click="dashboard.finished('${panel}')"/>
    </@efButtonGroup>
  </@efForm>
</script>
----
<.> Uses some local variables for `panel` and `variable` to make the logic clearer.
<.> A form that supports posting.  Defined as a dashboard-type form.
<.> Defines two input fields, with default values.
<.> Defines a button to POST the results to the controller.


This example displays a form in the dashboard with 2 input fields (`Serial Number` and `Customer ID`).

When the user presses the RMA button, the parameters are sent to the controller method `rma()`
which calls a service to create the RMA.  This service in turn, may call other services or
extensions that need to return messages.

See <<GUI Page Fragments and Dialogs>> for more details on the API used to generate dashboard
activities.  Most of the time, you won't need to directly use this API.

===== Non-GUI Activity

Dashboard activities with no or limited GUIs tend to use the values/inputs from the other activities
that are displayed.  A common use is in a selection panel that has an input field and a configured
button that triggers one of these non-GUI activities.  For example, you might have a dashboard with
two panels that looks like this:

image::guis/dashboard.png[Dashboard,align="center",width="75%"]

This dashboard has a single input field in the top panel and a button (Start) that acts on the
value from that field. When the button is pressed, the following non-GUI activity is loaded by the dashboard:

[source,html]
.Example - .FTL Page for Non-GUI Activity
----
<script>  // <.>
  ${params._variable}.execute =  function() {  // <.>
    var order = document.getElementById('order').value;  // <.>
    dashboard.postActivity({order: order},'/test/dashboard/start','${params._panel}', // <.>
                           {success: function(res) {ef.displayMessage({info: res})} });
  }
  ${params._variable}.cache =  true;  // <.>

</script>

----
<.> The non-GUI activity is javascript content that does not define the .display element.
<.> A function to be executed when the the activity is triggered.
<.> Gets the value of the order field (HTML Element ID='order').
<.> Sends the request to the server, with the order value.
<.> This activity content can be cached on the client since the content does not vary.

NOTE: Only use the *cache=true* setting if the activity content will never, ever change.

The <<reference.adoc#postactivity,postActivity()>> convenience function sends the request
to the server.  It will convert the object to a JSON payload and POST it to a URL.
The page will not be refreshed. This function also handles the standard message
<<reference.adoc#responses,Responses>> and support for <<Undo>>.
