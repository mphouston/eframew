==== Dashboard Configuration

The dashboard configurations are defined in a typical domain class
(link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/dashboard/domain/DashboardConfig.html[DashboardConfig^]),
but there are no standard definition GUIs for the classes.  Instead, the dashboard configuration
pages allow the user to alter the configurations. All dashboards must have a name and be stored
in the database.

===== Dashboard Categories

Dashboards are arranged into categories to allow you define the right kind of dashboard for the
right kind of task.  For example, you might want one type of dashboards for managers, but another
for supervisors. The category is not part of the primary key for a dashboard configuration.
This allows the URLs that displays a given dashboard to be simpler
(e.g. _/dashboard?category=MANAGER_).

===== Default Dashboards

Your application will probably need to provide some default dashboard configurations as examples
for your users. These are generally meant to be starting places for your users to rearrange into
suitable dashboards. The framework does not provide a default configuration.

===== Dashboard Editor

The dashboard editor allows you or your users to configure their own dashboards using
pre-defined activities or custom developer activities.  The editor allows you to configure
the panels, default sizes, buttons and activities available to the dashboard users:

This dialog represents the dashboard configuration.  It shows the buttons in the top panel, but the
specific location and orientation is determined by the activities used in the dashboard
(see <<Configurable Buttons>>).

You can select panels or buttons and use the context (right-click) menu to perform actions on
the selected element. The menus also allow you to modify the elements as you need.


For example, the _'Details...'_ menu will open the details dialog that allows you to change the
dashboard name, title or other top-level settings:

===== Configurable Buttons

Your dashboard can have common buttons defined by you or your users.  Each button will trigger one
or more activities to be displayed in specific panels in the dashboard.  This can be used to string
together several user actions with just a single click by your users.

These buttons are displayed in one of your panel activities that have the `DashboardButtons`
element defined.  For example, you might have a general-purpose selection
activity page that is displayed at the top of the dashboard that looks like this:

[source,html]
----
<@efForm id="wcSelection" dashboard="buttonHolder">  // <.>
  <@efField field="LSN.lsn" id="order" label="orderLsn.label"/>
</@efForm>
----
<.> This form will have the dashboard buttons added below the content.

NOTE: These configurable buttons are optional.  You can have no buttons or create your
      own controls as needed.

WARNING:  You should only have *ONE* activity at a time with a _buttonHolder_.


The buttons are stored as child
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/dashboard/domain/DashboardButton.html[DashboardButton^]
icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] records of the DashboardConfig object.  These buttons are
displayed one after another in the appropriate area of the page.  The buttons have configurable
labels, styling, title (tooltip) and display sequence.

Each button can be configured using the menu items in the dashboard editor dialog.  You can do this
by selecting the button and then using the context menu (right-click) to display the details.
The button details dialog looks like this:

image::guis/dashboardButtonDetails.png[DashboardButtonDetails,align="center",width="75%"]

WARNING: All buttons on activities must have a unique sequence.  This sequence will be used to
         order the buttons on the display and the execution sequence for the activities.

NOTE: If you have more than one button with the same button label, the dashboard will display one
      button with the multiple activities on it.  Each activity will be executed in sequence
      when the previous activity is finished.


====== Button Activities (Pages)

Each activity (page url) executed for a button can be executed in its own panel or sequentially
in a single panel. The pages displayed are defined in the Button Details dialog shown above.

It is possible to have multiple activities on a single button.
