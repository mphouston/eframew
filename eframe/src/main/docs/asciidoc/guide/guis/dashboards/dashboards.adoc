A dashboard is an instrument panel that gives your users information and allows them to interact
with and control some parts of your application.  Typically, this dashboard allows configuration
so that your users can tailor the display and behavior to their needs.  These dashboards can display
one or more pages in a resizable set of panels so that a lot of information can be visible to your
users to operate on.

The enterprise framework provides a core dashboard mechanism that lets you provide those features
to your customers. This dashboard uses small building blocks called <<Dashboard Activities>> to
make up elements of this dashboard.  You provide core activities to your users who can combine
them into usable dashboards for their purposes. These activities are specialized HTML pages that
use the <<Dashboard API>> to interact with the dashboard and perform actions for your users.


Dashboards are displayed with the <<efDashboard>> tag and the dashboard provides these
capabilities:

* 'Single page application' approach.
* Display 1 or more sub-pages (activities) in a user-adjustable layout.
* <<Dashboard Configuration>> with default configuration(s) for your application.
* Shared message area for non-GUI activities.
* <<Dashboard API>> for <<Dashboard Activities>> (page) lifecycle control.
* User-configurable action buttons.
* Javascript-based event system.
* Complex, configurable flows.

The dashboard activities are simple GSP/HTML pages that use the <<Dashboard API>> to perform most
actions.



==== Interactive Dashboard Flow

Dashboards can be used to display complex GUI flows with minimal user input.  This includes the
ability to display activities and let the user enter data.  These activities can display error
and result messages.  A typical dashboard flow for an interactive dashboard is shown below:

The steps in the flow above are:

. This flow starts with the initial display of the dashboard.  The Work Center selection
  panel is displayed at the top and a work list (order list) is shown in the bottom panel.
  The user-configurable buttons (Pass, Fail,...) are added to the top panel.
. The user presses the Fail button to display the 'Log Failure' activity in the lower panel.
. The user then enters an invalid code and presses the 'Log Failure' button.
. An error is displayed within the activity panel, allowing the user to correct the inputs.
. The user fixes the input and successfully logs a failure code.
. The default activity (a work list) is displayed in the lower panel and a blue information
  message is shown in the shared message are for the dashboard.

More complex flows can be configured through the button configuration and with smart activities
in the dashboard. The <<Dashboard API>> provides the functions needed to orchestrate complex
flows as needed.

Most of the Javascript APIs use the panel name from the dashboard definition to select specific
panels to operate on. These panel names are automatically assigned (A, B, C...), but you can
assign your own name in the configuration GUI or in the CRUD API for the
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/dashboard/domain/DashboardConfig.html[DashboardConfig^]

==== Custom Dashboard Page

The standard dashboard page (e.g. _views/dashboard/index.ftl_) uses the javascript assets for the dashboard.
The <<Dashboard API>> is provided for your dashboard activities by the core dashboard pages.
You can define your own dashboard page if needed.  See <<Dashboard Activities>> for details.

==== Debugging Dashboard Activities

Dashboards are complex.  They have a lot of pieces that need to work together.  You may need
to use these techniques to track down problems:

* Enabled 'client.dashboard' logging. See below.
* Check for Javascript syntax errors in the panel activity source. See below.


===== Dashboard Logging Levels

Some of the <<Logging>> settings are shown below.

[cols="2,1,4",width=95%]
|===
|Object|Setting | Description

|client.dashboard| *debug*| Logging of events send by dashboard.
|client.dashboard| *trace*| Verbose logging of definitions used by the client dashboard libraries.
|
|===

===== Dashboard Activity Source

The source for each dashboard activity is a _.ftl_ file that is loaded dynamically by the dashboard.
This contains Javascript, which is rendered as HTML by the <<GUI Toolkit>> library.
The Javascript syntax can be complex and deeply nested.  Sometimes, it is good to grab the source
and view it in an _.html_ scratch file in the IDE (IDEA is a good choice).  You
can grab the response from the browser's developer tools window (see the _Network_ tab in
Chrome DevTools - F12).

This allows you to see the syntax errors clearly as shown below:
