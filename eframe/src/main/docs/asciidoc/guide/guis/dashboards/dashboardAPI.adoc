===== Dashboard Javascript Library

The link:reference.html#dashboard-js[Dashboard Javascript Library^]
icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] provides the Javascript support for using the dashboard.
This library is the main way that your custom dashboard activities can interact with the dashboard.

This dashboard library is used with the <<efDashboard>> marker to handle the complex interactions
between the dashboard and its related activities.  The example below shows the basic usage of the
dashboard logic.  The key functions are documented in this section.



The dashboard works with <<Dashboard Activities>>, which are specialized HTML pages.
The Javascript API allows your activities to interact with the dashboard and perform actions for
your users. The Javascript API provides access to the dashboard features and allows interaction
with dashboard events. The API also allows the dashboard activities to interact with each other.

The detailed dashboard API functions are briefly discussed below, but are also covered in the
reference at the right. These include:

* <<reference.adoc#finished,finished()>>
* <<reference.adoc#load,load()>>
* <<reference.adoc#reset-to-defaults,resetToDefaults()>>

The main eframe JS toolkit also provides some key functions:

* <<reference.adoc#eframe-display-message,displayMessage()>>
* <<reference.adoc#eframe-clear-messages,clearMessages()>>



===== Javascript Variable: dashboard

The standard dashboard pages (e.g. _views/dashboard/index.ftl_) use the javascript assets for the
dashboard. The Javascript API is provided for your dashboard activities by the core dashboard pages.
Within a dashboard, the activities can access the common dashboard API using the `dashboard`
Javascript object:

[source,html]
.Example Dashboard Activity - .ftl
----
<#assign panel = "${params._panel}"/>
<@efForm id="logFailure">  // <.>
  <@efField field="RMA.serialNumber" label="Serial Number"/>   // <.>
  <@efField field="RMA.customerID" label="Customer ID"/>
  <@efButtonGroup>
    <@efButton label="Log Failure"
               click="dashboard.postActivity('logFailure','/test/dashboard/echo','${panel}');"/> // <.>
    <@efButton label="cancel.label" click="dashboard.finished('${panel}',{cancel: true})"/> // <.>
  </@efButtonGroup>
</@efForm>

----
<.> The form that will be posted via AJAX.
<.> The two input fields needed.
<.> The buttons to submit or cancel the action.
<.> The <<reference.adoc#finished,finished>> function closes the dialog.

This simple activity displays input fields and buttons for the actions.


===== Javascript Errors

Any critical errors from the dashboard framework will be displayed in the normal dashboard
messages section. Anytime you call a javascript function with invalid arguments is considered a
critical error. See <<reference.adoc#eframe-display-message,displayMessage()>> for details.

===== Dashboard Events

A typical dashboard has a number of <<Dashboard Activities>> displayed at a given time.
Your application may need to coordinate behavior between these activities.  For example,
a selection list may need to inform another activity that the selection has changed.
<<dashboard-event-reference,Events>> can be used
to allow your activities to communicate these type of changes.

NOTE: Most events are defined by the application.  This framework only provides the
      <<BUTTON_PRESSED>> event.

It is also sometimes necessary for one activity to set parameters passed to another activity
when it is initially displayed.  One common problem with dashboard activities is that one
activity may have out of date values from another module.  In the diagram below, a user
may enter a Work Center, then press the 'Pass' button.  It is important that the current
value is used by the new activity(s) when they are displayed. There is an API defined that allows
your activities to be called when new activity is displayed in a panel (due to a button press).

The goal behind these two sets of functions is to make sure that all activities can have the
current values from the other activities and know when important events happen in other activities.

See below for two examples:

.Dashboard Events
image::models/DashboardEvents.png[Dashboard Events,align="center"]

The first example shows a single application-defined event.  The event is triggered by the activity
when the user changes the work center field.  The sequence is:

. User changes the field value.
. Event is sent to all listening activities.

The second example shows the events when a user presses a configured dashboard button:

. User presses the configured dashboard button.
. The parameters that might be needed by the activity is queried by all registered parameter
  functions. This example gets the current work center value and returns it in a Javascript
  object.
. The framework then collects all of the parameters from the activities and then passes these as
  HTTP parameters to the activity(s) associated with the button.
. Finally, a button pressed event is sent to all event listeners.



====== Implementing Event Functions

The `handleEvent()` function is used for your activity to react to events from other
dashboard activities. Typically, this is used to react to user actions such as selecting an
entry in a list. For example:

[source,groovy]
.Example .ftl activity with handleEvent()
----

<script>
  ${params._variable}.handleEvent = function(event) { // <.>
    if (event.type == 'SELECTION_CHANGED') {
      . . . // <.>
    }
  }
</script>
----
<.> The `handleEvent()` function.  This function must use the `variable`
    parameter mechanism to make a unique handler function.
<.> Your code to react to the event.

====== Sending Events

Most dashboard events are defined by your application.  These depend heavily on the features of your
dashboard activities.  To send an event you need to use javascript like this:

[source,javascript]
.Example Javascript to Trigger Dashboard Event
----
  function onBlur${panel}(...) {  // <.>
    var event = {type: 'SELECTION_CHANGED', source: 'example', listID='OrderList'};  // <.>
    dashboard.sendEvent(event);
  }
----
<.> Some function that handles user events in your activity.
<.> The event object.  Must have a `type` property.


===== Dashboard Event Reference

The framework only publishes a few events. The application level code generally sends more events.

===== BUTTON_PRESSED

This event is published when a user presses a user-configurable button in the dashboard.
These are buttons that can be added/removed in the <<Dashboard Configuration>> pages.

NOTE: This event is not automatically triggered by the dashboard framework for static HTML buttons
      defined in you activities.

The fields for this event are shown below.


[cols="1,4",width=75%]
|===
|Field | Description

|*type* | The event type ('BUTTON_PRESSED').
|*source* | The source of the event.  Usually the name of the dashboard activity (e.g. 'workList').
|*button* | The button sub-object that defines the user-configured button.  Includes all definition
            values for the button, such as:
|*button.buttonID* | The ID of the button.
|
|===

[[dashboard-provide-parameters,provideParameters Functions]]
===== Provided Parameters Functions

The `provideParameters()` function is used for your activity to get the current values for any
parameters to be passed to button activities.  Typically, this is used to get the current value
from input fields in your activity to be passed to the button activity(s).


An example:

[source,groovy]
.Example .ftl activity with provideParameters()
----
<script>
  <@efForm id="logFailure" dashboard="buttonHolder">
    <@efField field="rma" value="RMA1001" width=20/>  // <.>
    <@efField field="product" value="CM3056857"/>
    <@efButtonGroup>
      <@efButton label="Log Failure" click="dashboard.postActivity(...);"/>
      <@efButton label="cancel.label" click="dashboard.finished('${panel}')"/>
    </@efButtonGroup>
  </@efForm>

  ${params._variable}.provideParameters = function() {  // <.>
    return {
      workCenter: $('#workCenter').val(),  // <.>
    }
  }

</script>

----
<.> The user input fields we need to provide the current value to other activities.
<.> The `provideParameters()` function (unique to each panel, so the `_variable` is used to make
    the name unique.
<.> Grabs the current value of the input field an returns it in a javascript object.  This is added
    to the URL for new activities as they are displayed.



===== Dashboard JS Library Functions

The dashboard object provides many javascript functions to access the dashboard features.
These functions take simple values or javascript objects (map-style) for more complex inputs.
For example:

[source,javascript]
.Example
----
dashboard.finished({panel: 'B'});
----

[[dashboard-finished,finished()]]
====== finished()

The <<reference.adoc#finished,finished()>> function notifies the dashboard that a given activity
is finished. This closes the activity and replaces it with the default or next activity page.

[source,groovy]
.Example - dashboard.finished()
----
dashboard.finished({panel: 'B', info: ['Order 1234 Cancelled.','Order 1234 Archived.']}); // <.>
----
<.> Finishes the activity (closing it) with two info messages.
