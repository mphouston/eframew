==== Dashboard Reports

Dashboards frequently need to display <<Reports>> on demand.  One of the <<Dashboard Activities>>
provided will let the user display reports in a new browser tab.

==== Report Activity

*uri:* `/report/reportActivity`

This Report activity is a <<GUI Activity>> that lists all defined reports, each on a button.
This allows the dashboard user to display any report.  The report is passed all
parameters as defined in the <<Dashboard API>>.

After the report is displayed, this report dashboard activity will finish and re-display the
original activity in the panel.

NOTE: This activity will open the report in the original window if the application is
      run in the Test environment.  Otherwise, the report will be opened in a new window.
