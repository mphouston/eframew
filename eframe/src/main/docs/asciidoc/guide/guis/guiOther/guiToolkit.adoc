=== GUI Toolkit

The enterprise framework relies on a third-party javascript UI library,
https://webix.com/[Webix^].  This library provides the basic widgets to interact with the user.
Most application-level code that you write will not need to access these directly.
There is always a chance that the GUI Toolkit might change in the future (it changed twice during
initial development).

The <<Standard Header>> for view pages always includes this javascript library in all pages.
There are a number of utility functions in the <<Javascript Libraries>> that you can
use when needed.
