==== GUI State Persistence

The standard GUI elements generally are configurable and remember the user's state between executions.  This means
important settings like column ordering and column size are persisted between visits to the page.  Once a user
resizes and gets the GUI just the way they want it, the framework will always display the GUI that way in the future.
Also, users tend to move from work station to work station and having their GUI state preserved is a good idea.

The elements that remember state are:

* <<efShow>>
* <<efCreate>>
* <<efEdit>>
* <<efDefinitionList>>
* <<Reports And Charts>>
* <<Dashboards>>

As the user changes the settings in the GUI, these changes are stored in the
server-side database.  If the user is not logged in, then the changes are not saved.

The link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/preference/PreferenceHolder.html[PreferenceHolder^] provides
access to this persisted state.
Each major HTML element on the page has a settings object that is stored in XML in the database.
These settings are used the next time the user displays the page.

==== Philosophy

Some people might ask: why not use HTML5's local storage mechanism?  Local storage is a great fit for a traditional
web-app.  Any one user's GUI settings should not affect any others.  Enterprise apps tend to have many options,
fields and toggles for the user to work through.  Generally, a system admin will need to configure the GUIs to
hide the fields that are not important to that company.

This means the GUI settings need to be pre-configurable.  This framework stores these pre-configured GUIs on the
server as named user preferences (see TBD below) so that new users will get the company's 'standard' settings.
If we stored the preferences on the client's local storage, then this 'named' setting feature would not work.

Also, users can move from device to device.  We did not want to force the users to re-adjust
their GUIs on each device.

NOTE: In some cases, we do use HTML5's local storage.  For example, the current tab is
      remembered for the tabbed panels (see <<efShow>>).  This is done when the user may
      switch tabs frequently and we did not want to overload the server with updates
      on each tab switch.

===== Where to stored state?

The initial idea we had was to store the GUI state in the session for quicker access.  This
would tend to make the session much larger than it needed.  We wanted to keep the session small and
allow you to store the user's session in a cookie to make it easier to switch servers.

To do this, we decided to rely on the second level database cache to hold the user preferences for quicker
access.  In simple testing, the DB access time for the user settings was less than 5% of the total
response time.  This seemed like a reasonable performance hit for the ability to move a user
between servers easily.


==== GUI Preference Persistence

Imagine a simple listing page that allows the user to sort, resize, re-order and choose the columns to display:

image::guis/list.png[list,align="center",width="750"]


The users will want to resize the columns and sort on import fields.  The framework allows the user to change these
settings and it will remember them the next time the page is displayed.

===== Object Model

The user preferences are stored in a simple table with an XML representation of the preference
details.  The model is shown below:

//workaround for https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/issues/271
:imagesdir: {imagesdir-build}

[plantuml,"preferencesERD",align="center"]
----
@startuml
class UserPreference {
  String page : '/order/list'
  String user : 'admin'
  List<Preference> preferences
  String preferencesXML
}
note right: database table: USER_PREFERENCE\nPreference.name = HTML elementName


class Preference {
   String element : 'OrderList'
   String name
   List<PreferenceSettingInterface> settings
}
note right: stored as XML Map in preferenceXML

interface PreferenceSettingInterface {
   {field} String key : 'qtyToBuild' (column name)
   {field}  (values)  : width = 237
}
note right: For example: ColumnPreference\nMust implement TypeableJSONInterface.

UserPreference -- Preference
Preference -- PreferenceSettingInterface

The link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/user/UserPreference.html[UserPreference^] class is the
main domain class that is saved for each user (or a default for all users). Inside of this domain
class, the actual preferences are stored in various POGOs and saved in the `preferencesXML` column
(typically a CLOB or large text object).

In the example above, the column settings for a <<efDefinitionList,list column>> are shown.
The link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/user/Preference.html[Preference^]
object is defined for each HTML element that needs preferences.  The _Preference_ object contains
a List that holds a number of POGO elements with the actual preferences.  The _ColumnPreference_
above is one example.

The `settings` list contains the specific column width/sorting defined for the grid.  Each setting
in this case has its `key` set to the column name. The
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/user/ColumnPreferenceSetting.html[ColumnPreferenceSetting^]
objects, one for each column with a preference. This includes the display sequence, width and
sorting details.

NOTE: The POGO preference settings should implement the
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/json/TypeableJSONInterface.html[TypeableJSONInterface^]
icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"].  The base class
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/preference/BasePreferenceSetting.html[BasePreferenceSetting^]
icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] does this for you.

===== Setting and Using Preferences

The GUI preferences is a complex data structure that is stored in the database
The basic objects are shown below.  This includes an example of the values stored for
the size of an Order grid column.


You should use the link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/preference/PreferenceHolder.html[PreferenceHolder^]
DSL class to access the users preferences.  For example, to set a column size preference, the
code would be:

[source,groovy]
.Example Set Preference
----

PreferenceHolder preference = PreferenceHolder.find {  // <1>
  page '/app/testPage'
  user 'admin'
  element 'OrderList'
}

def columnPref = preference[column] ?: new ColumnPreference(column: column) // <2>
columnPref.width = newSize  // <3>
preference.setPreference(columnPref).save() // <4>

----
<1> Finds the right set of preferences by the key (column name in this case).
<2> Finds existing preference for the column or creates a default preference for it.
<3> Sets the new value.
<4> Saves to database.  This will create a new record if needed.


This finds the preference for the given page and user for the HTML element 'OrderList'.
This preference contains a List of _ColumnPreference_ (objects).
Each type of HTML element has different sets of preferences, but each one needs a unique key.

WARNING: The value used in the PreferenceHolder DSL might evaluate to null.  Be careful
         with constants from the class you are using the preference holder in.
         You might need to use a qualified reference to the constant.  For example:
         `SelectionController.WORK_CENTER`.  If you just use `WORK_CENTER`, then that value
         might evaluate to null.

Below is an example of retrieving the column size preference:

[source,groovy]
.Example Get Preference
----

PreferenceHolder preference = PreferenceHolder.find {  // <1>
  page '/app/testPage'
  user 'admin'
  element 'OrderList'
}

def width = preference['orderDate']?.width // <2>

----
<1> Finds the right set of preferences by the key (column name in this case).
<2> Gets the setting object for the column and grabs the `width` (if not null).



===== GUI Preference Event Flow

A typical preferences change flow from the GUI (browser) to the persisted preferences is
shown below:


//workaround for https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/issues/271
:imagesdir: {imagesdir-build}

[plantuml,"ColumnResizeFlow",align="center"]
----
@startuml
actor user #red
user -> GUI: resize
participant "UserPreference\nController" as UserPreferenceController
GUI -> UserPreferenceController: columnResized()
participant "UserPreference\nService" as UserPreferenceService
UserPreferenceController -> UserPreferenceService: guiStateChanged()
UserPreferenceService -> ColumnResized: handle()
database UserPreference
ColumnResized -> UserPreference: save()

@enduml
----

//end workaround for https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/issues/271
:imagesdir: {imagesdir-src}



The steps in this flow are:

. User resizes column in GUI.
. Change event is sent to `UserPreferenceController.guiStateChanged()` method.  This includes
  event-specific information such as the column name and the new size.
. The change event is handled by the `UserPreferenceService` in a transactional method.
. An event handler class (_ColumnResized_) is used to process the data from the GUI.  This
  includes some validation. Most number parsing errors are ignored.
. The _UserPreference_ class determines when to save the value to database (typically upon commit).

When the GUI is re-displayed, the last column width set byt the user is used.

==== Named Settings (TBD)

The framework supports named settings.  A user may have several configurations that they want to save and re-use later.
In the configuration pages, the user can pick one named setting as their default setting, or temporarily use another
setting.

These named settings can also be defined for the entire system (all users).  These can be the default setting for all users
that can be overridden by specific users as needed.

NOTE: Once a user makes a significant change to the GUI (e.g. adds a new column or changes the sort order), they will start using
their own settings instead of the global settings. If the global default settings are changed later, then this user won't see
those changes. The user can revert to the global settings by selecting it in the configuration page for the display element
(e.g. grid).  Simple changes like column resizing won't cause this divergence from the global setting, but most other changes
will.
