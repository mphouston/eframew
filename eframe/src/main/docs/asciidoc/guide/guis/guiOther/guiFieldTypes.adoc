=== GUI Field Types

The GUI <<Markers>> support fields of specific <<Field Types>>.  These are shown in
the forms (e.g. <<Definition Pages>>) as various UI widgets (e.g. text field, combobox, grid,
etc).

==== Inline Grids

Inline grids are used to show/edit child records of a parent record.  For example, the flex field
is create page is shown below:

image::guis/flexTypeCreate.png[title="Flex Type Create",align="center", width=75%]

This inline grid allows you to edit the values, add/remove rows and save the changes.

These inline grids can have options passed to them using the normal <<Markers and Options>> approach
for the definition markers.  For example, to make the grid _'steps'_ read-only in the Routing
edit GUI, you could use this marker:

[source,html]
.edit.ftl for Routing
----
<@efEdit fields="routing,title,steps" steps@readOnly="true"/> // <.>

----
<.> The _'steps'_ grid will not allow changes.
