The main goal of this framework is to make your job as easy as possible.
One of the ways we do this is to provide a common pattern for basic things your
application must do.

One of the key parts of your application is how users can create and maintain the basic
objects your application needs to function.  For example, you might need an online _Order_
object.  Your users will need the ability to Create, Read, Update and Delete these orders.
These are the CRUD actions.

The framework provides easy ways to support these CRUD functions for moderately
complex domain objects.  This is done with a combination of convention, high-level
<<Markers>> and support classes to build your GUIs quickly.

Using standardized pages, markers and controllers, the framework supports this standard
definition page flow:

The user initially browses to the 'List' page.  Here, they can select a record, create
a record or narrow the list by using the search function.

The 'Create' page allows the user to enter values for a new record and save them
in the database.

The 'Show' page displays the record's fields and allows the user to delete or jump to the
'Edit' page as needed.

The 'Edit' page allows the user to change values and save them.

The following diagram shows the flow with some sample pages:

image::guis/DefFlow.png[title="Definition Flow",align="center", width=95%]


The markers that support these pages are:

* <<efList>>
* <<efShow>>
* <<efCreate>>
* <<efEdit>>

Your definition pages (e.g. _list.ftl, show.ftl_, etc) should include the standard definition
include file:

[source,html]
.Definition Page Includes
----
<#assign title><@efTitle type='list'/></#assign>

<#include "../includes/header.ftl" />
<#include "../includes/definition.ftl" />  // <.>

<@efList/>
<@efPreloadMessages codes="cancel.label"/>

<#include "../includes/footer.ftl" />

----
<.> This includes the javascript needed for most definition pages.


==== BaseCrudController and Models

These definition pages need some data to display in the browser.  This data is normally
retrieved by the <<BaseCrudController>>.  The domain object is stored as described in
<<Standard Domain Model and Markers>> (e.g. under the domain name _'order'_).

For example, if you have an Order domain with a show page, you can access the order fields
using .ftl/HTML code like this:

[source,html]
.Show Order Page - Use of Model
----
<#assign title><@efTitle type='show'/></#assign>

<#include "../includes/header.ftl" />
<#include "../includes/definition.ftl" />

Due Date: ${order.dueDate}  // <.>

<@efForm id="show">
    <@efShow fields="order,title,qtyToBuild"/>  // <.>
</@efForm>

<#include "../includes/footer.ftl" />

----
<.> The `dueDate` from the model is displayed before the normal show fields.
<.> The normal show portion of the display.

==== Definition Page Messages

All core definition pages support the ability to display a message at the top of the page.
This is done by adding a URL parameter for _info_ or _error_ messages (URL Encoded):

  /order/show/99585d6d-9681-4407-ba49-9c7d0297044d?_error=Can%27t+release+more+quantity.
