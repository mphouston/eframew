The <<GUI Toolkit>> provides the client-side rendering of UI elements for pages and other
UIs.  This toolkit does not use standard HTML on the definition of UI elements.  Instead,
it uses Javascript objects that are rendered to HTML elements on the client.
This means the server-side page generation is done by creating Javascript objects and calling
the toolkit display logic (e.g. _webix.ui()_).

This approach works well with standard pages and the framework's <<Markers>> used to build the
pages.  The problem comes when we need to render fragments of a page in <<Dashboards>> and in
dialogs.  To solve this problem, the framework supports a simple API to let you define
these page fragments in a clean, simple way.

==== Page Fragment API

The page fragment mechanism is based on normal page rendering.  A controller will serve up a
page using the <<StandardModelAndView>> approach.  These pages are not normal pages, but some of the
normal markers can be used:

* <<efForm>>
* <<efField>>
* <<efButton>>

You will also likely need to use native <<GUI Toolkit>> Javascript logic for any non-standard cases.

The fragment API relies on a global variable to temporarily store the Javascript object(s) to be
displayed for the client to use.  This variable can also provide some Javascript to un after the
display is rendered.

This global client-side variable is passed to the dialog logic as __variable_.
See <<Dialog Example>>.

The supported elements on the variable are:

*  *display* - A Javascript plain object that will be used in the <<GUI Toolkit>> rendering
               mechanism.  The object will be added to the dialog/dashboard using a call to
               _webix.ui()_.

*  *postScript* - A string that contains the javascript to execute after the display object
                  is rendered. This can be used to request focus on a specific field if needed.


==== Dialog Example

A good example of this is a simple dialog that allows the user the change the name
for a custom panel in a definition GUI.

The dialog content is provided by the controller URI:
 _/extension/dialog?dialog=extension/editPanelDialog&_variable=_dialogContent_.
The global variable used by the dialog logic is __dialogContent_.  The dialog contents
This _addPanelDialog.ftl_ looks something like this:

[source,javascript]
.Example - Add Panel Dialog
----
<@efPreloadMessages codes="ok.label,cancel.label,  // <.>
                           definitionEditor.addPanel.title,panel.label,error.1.message"/>

<@efForm id="addPanel" dashboard="true">  // <.>
  <@efField field="panel" value="custom" width=20 required="true"/>
</@efForm>

${params._variable}.postScript = '$$("panel").getInputNode().focus()'; // <.>

----
<.> Defines the labels needed for localized content.
<.> Tells the form to generate logic for a fragment, not a full page.
<.> This defines the post script execute after rendering.  It requests the focus on the input field.

[source,javascript]
.Example - Open the Dialog
----
ef.displayDialog({
  bodyURL: '/extension/dialog?dialog=extension/addPanelDialog',  // <.>
  buttons: ['ok', 'cancel'],
  ok: function (dialogID, button) {  // <.>
    var panel = $$('panel').getValue();
     . . .
  }
});

----
<.> Retrieves the dialog contents from a server-side page.
<.> The logic executed when the user presses Ok.  Includes getting the value from the input field.
