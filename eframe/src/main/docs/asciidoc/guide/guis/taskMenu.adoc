Complex enterprise applications usually have many tasks that a user can perform.  This framework
provides a simple pop-up task menu that is always visible in the upper left corner.  This is displayed
with a mouse-click or when the kbd:[F9] is pressed.

image::guis/taskMenu.png[title="TaskMenu",align="center", width=33%]

This menu is configured automatically by the various controllers in your application.  It includes
the main entry points for the framework GUIs and your application GUIs.  Typically, this will include
the root (or _index_) page from the user-accessible controllers for your <<Definition Pages>>.

NOTE: The displayed text strips any single or double quote from the display value, ID or
      tooltip for the task menu.  This is done for performance reasons.  This includes
      the displayed text and tooltip.



[[task-menu-setup]]
==== Setup

Setup is fairly simple.  The controllers define the
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/web/task/TaskMenuItem.html[TaskMenuItems^] icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"]
available from your controller.  This is usually just the index page, but can includes specific
pages if needed.  For example, the _'/search/admin'_ page is added to the menu in the Admin section.

An example controller would expose the index page as shown:


[source,groovy]
.OrderController
----
                            // <.>
def taskMenuItems = [new TaskMenuItem(folder: 'demand:50.order:100',  // <.>
                                      name: 'order',                  // <.>
                                      uri: '/order',
                                      displayOrder: 101)]             // <.>


----
<.> Defines the list of _TaskMenuItems_ that this controller provides for user access.
<.> The `folder` is a combined field that defines the parent folder(s) for this menu item and
    the display order for the folder.  Folder levels are separated by a period ('.') and
    the display order for the folder is added with a colon (':') after each level.
<.> The _name_ is used to determine the display value.  If the _"taskMenu.name.label"_ and
    _"taskMenu.name.tooltip"_
    exist in _messages.properties_ file, then those values will be used in the menu.  If not
    in the properties file, then the _name_ will be used as-is.  This same approach is used
    for the folder names above.
<.> `displayOrder` controls the order this menu entry will be displayed in inside of the folder.
    See <<Display Order>> below.

The display orders are used as a relative value.  If not provided by the TaskMenuItem, then it
will be assigned by the system.  This might result in semi-random ordering.

NOTE: The default task menu is cached in a singleton
      link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/web/task/TaskMenuHelper.html[TaskMenuHelper^]
      icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] on first use.  This cache is not use in development
      mode.

This is all handled by the _includes/header.ftl_ file.  Your code should not
need to worry about this detail.





[[task-menu-display-order]]
==== Display Order

Each level in the task menu can control the order elements are displayed in.  This is done
by specifying a `displayOrder` value on the folder definition or on the menu item.
If no value is defined, then a value is assigned in alphabetical order from 9000.


Since your application is made up of multiple plugins working together, it is important to
have a consistent display ordering scheme.  The framework's basic folders are shown below (with their
display ordering):

*  Custom  - 100
**    FlexType - 110
*  Dashboard - 200
**    Operator - 210
**    Manager - 220
*  _Demand - 500  (Application)_
**    _Orders - 510_
**    _LSN - 520_
*  _Reports (Application) - 5000 - 5999_
**  _Reports from resources/reports folder - 5000 - 5499_
*  Search - 6000
**    Global Search - 6010
*  Admin - 7000
**    Global Settings - 7010
**    Logging - 7020
**    Background Tasks - 7025
**    Search Admin - 7030
**    System Status - 7040
**    User - 7050

////
**  Performance - 7100
***    Monitor - 7110
***    Metric Summary - 7120
***    Alert - 7130
***    Metric Setting - 7140
////


This allows application-level modules to add their folders to existing framework folders or create
their own.  See the module documentation for specific details on their folders.


[[task-menu-errors]]
==== Error Handling

If there are errors in the task menu items in your controllers, then a message will be logged
when the task menu is generated.  This menu item will be ignored and the others will be processed.

[[task-menu-runtime-flow]]
==== Runtime Flow

The task menu is potentially displayed on every page in your application.  This means performance
is very important. The runtime flow is designed for high performance.  This means the flow is a
little more complex than most widgets in the framework.

In particular, the menu is not built until the user clicks the task menu button.  This reduces
the page display time for most pages.  The menu is stored in the page until is is needed to
build the menu.  This reduces the page display time and avoids an extra request for menu definition.

Also, the menu is cached by the browser for a period time.  This cache period is 24 hours by default.
This can be changed in the configuration setting: `cacheStableResources`.
See link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/application/EFrameConfiguration.html[EFrameConfiguration^]
icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] for details.  To change this in your _application.yml_ file, you
can use this approach:

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
.Example Cache Setting - Task Menu
----
eframe.cacheStableResources: 120 // <.>
----
<.> The task menu and similar resources are cache on the browser for 120 seconds.

You can force a refresh using the browser refresh feature (e.g. kbd:[Ctrl-F5] in Chrome).

NOTE: In production and test mode, the menu is built just once and cached in the server for all
      future uses. In development mode, the menu is not cached to simplify the addition of your
      menu items during development.  This is in addition to the client-side cache which works
      in development and production modes.
