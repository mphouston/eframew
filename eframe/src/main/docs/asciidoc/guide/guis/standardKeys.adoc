=== Standard Keys

There are a number of standard keystroke definitions that are used throughout the framework GUIs
and should be followed in the application defined GUIs.  The common keys (with Chrome
Windows bindings) are shown below:

[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Keystroke|Description

|kbd:[Alt+A]|Add row to an inline grid.
|kbd:[F9]|Display <<Task Menu>>.
|kbd:[space]|Select <<Task Menu>> or start editing in an editable grid.
|kbd:[enter]|Select <<Task Menu>> or start editing in an editable grid.
|===

Some of these common keystrokes may be defined for multiple elements on the page.  For example,
your page might have two inline grids, which support the kbd:[Alt+A] access key.  When this happens,
the browser will honor one of the assignments, chosen by the browser.  Typically, this is the last
element that defines the given access key.

NOTE: Firefox uses the kbd:[Shift+Alt] instead of the normal kbd:[Alt] for access keys.
