==== eframe_toolkit.js

The enterprise framework relies on a third-party <<GUI Toolkit>> for much of the display
and layout in your application pages.  These use the javascript functions in the
_eframe_toolkit.js_ library to hide much of the toolkit-related dependencies.

Most of these functions should not be called by your application code.  Only a few are useful and
are documented here:


* <<reference.adoc#eframe-toolkit-pw,pw>> - Calculate the width in pixels, given as a percentage of the screen width.
* <<reference.adoc#eframe-toolkit-ph,ph>> - Calculate the height in pixels, given as a percentage of the screen height.

NOTE: Any methods that start with an underscore (eg. `tk._alert()`) are internal methods
      and are subject to change.
