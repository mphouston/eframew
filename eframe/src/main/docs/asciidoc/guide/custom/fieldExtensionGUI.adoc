=== Field Extension GUI

Once you have a field added to a domain class, you will normally need to display them in a GUI.
This is done with the normal <<gui-configuration>> icon in a domain definition GUI.  Opening the
configuration editor for a domain GUI shows a dialog like this:

image::guis/configurationForDefinition.png[configurationForDefinition,align="center",width=75%]

This dialog allows you to add custom fields to the definition GUIs.  It also allows you to move
or remove base fields from the display.

==== Definition Configuration Dialog

The configuration dialog for definition GUIs (above) allows you to add new custom fields to
a domain object, change existing custom fields or remove them.  This GUI also allows you to
re-order the fields and create tabbed panels for organizing complex definition objects.

===== Configuration Actions

The actions allowed are:

. Add Custom Field
. Edit/Delete Custom Field

====== Edit/Delete Custom Field

You can edit the custom field by selecting it in either list and using menu entry 'Edit Custom Field'.
You can also double-click the entry to open the custom field editor dialog.

NOTE: Changes made in this dialog are immediately saved in the database and affects the current
      domain objects in the system. Deleting a custom field does not remove the field values from
      existing domain objects, but the values are no longer visible in the definition GUIs.


====== Custom Field Editor Dialog

This custom field editor dialog allows you to change the details of this custom field.
You can't change the field name since this is a key value for data in the database and
also affects the field order described below.


==== FieldOrder

The <<Field Ordering>> defined for a domain class controls what order fields are shown in the
definition GUIs and lists. You can customize the appearance of a GUI by manipulating this field
order.  The configuration editor makes it easy to manipulate the order and even add new custom
fields to the domain class.

The `fieldOrder` list will look something like this:

[source,groovy]
.fieldOrder
----
class FlexType {
  . . .
  static fieldOrder = ['flexType', 'category', 'title', 'defaultFlexType', 'fields']
  . . .
}
----

An example Flex Type edit page is shown below:

image::guis/userEditDef.png[UserEditDef,align="center",width=75%]

This gives the default ordering seen above.  You can customize the field ordering using the
configuration dialog.

image::guis/configurationForDefinition.png[configurationForDefinition,align="center",width=75%]

This shows how someone added a custom field (`legacyCode`) to the user GUIs. The user wants the
`legacyCode` field to be added to the FlexType object and be displayed before the `title`.

This is stored in the
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/custom/domain/FieldGUIExtension.html[FieldGUIExtension^]
icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] object to
persist this customization for the domain class.  In the FieldGUIExtension object, there is a
list of adjustments made to the field order in a list format. This is portrayed in the
diagram below for the example customizations above:

The FieldGUIExtension is created for the domain class to be customized (User in this case).
Inside of this FieldGUIExtension is an `extensionsJSON` field that holds the JSON form of the
extensions list. This is a list of
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/custom/gui/FieldAdjustmentInterface.html[FieldAdjustmentInterface^]
icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] elements
that define what adjustments are made to the default field order for the domain class.

In this case, the `legacyCode` is inserted before the `title` field.  The class
relationships are shown below:

Other GUI field placement actions are allowed:

[cols="1,3", width=65]
|===
|Adjustment|Description

|Insert|Insert custom field/group after a core field/group.
|InsertAll|Insert all custom fields after a core field/group.
|MoveAfter|Move a core field/group to after another core field/group.
|=== 

It is possible to add a group (tabbed panel).  If the core GUI doesn't use tabbed panels,
then this will create a 'Main' panel for first fields in the `fieldOrder` list.

These adjustments are implemented as action classes that implement the
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/custom/gui/FieldAdjustmentInterface.html[FieldAdjustmentInterface^]
icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"].
These adjustments manipulate the effective field order for the domain class.
