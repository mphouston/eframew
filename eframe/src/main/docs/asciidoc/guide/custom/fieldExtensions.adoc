The Enterprise Framework module lets the user define custom fields for most domain objects.
These are stored in a single string column in the domain object.  You (as the application
developer) must enable this feature on the domain classes that need this ability.
Once enabled, the end user can add custom fields and adjust the definition GUIs as they like.

The <<Configurable Types>>, <<Flex Types>> and <<Module Additions>> are based on features of
these field extensions. These features share a lot of common code.

NOTE: This feature is not yet compatible with clustering.  A manual restart of all nodes in the
      cluster is needed when changes are made to this definition.


==== Design Decisions

All of the decisions below are based on a number of assumptions on the use of custom fields:

* Most use cases will need a few custom fields at any given time (5-10).
* In extreme cases, users may define a large number of custom fields in each domain (100+).
* Most use cases will likely be reading the value (80% read, 20% write).
* Users will sometimes not be able to restart the server to add a custom field.
  Downtime is not allowed.
* Configuration objects (e.g. Products) and production objects (e.g. Orders) will both
  need user-defined fields added.  The configuration objects will use one type of customizations
  (<<Field Extensions>>) and production objects will tend to use another type (<<Flex Types>>).

When designing the custom field support, we had hoped to store each custom field value in its own
database column. Unfortunately, that was not possible with Micronaut Data.  Micronaut Data requires
that persisted fields be compiled into the domain classes. This would force a recompilation/restart
of the application just to add a custom field. Instead, we chose to store all custom fields into a
single text column.  Each custom field still appears as a dynamic
field in the domain class, but they are all persisted to a single text column.

This leads to some limitations.  We feel these limitations are worth the extra flexibility.
Most importantly: The user can change the fields on the fly without restarting the application server.

Another key decision was made to use JSON for the encoding of the fields into the database column.
This allows most database engines to extract the values as needed in ad-hoc SQL.  This JSON is a
little more verbose than the absolute minimum, but it
is best for compatibility with the external tools.

Another decision was to keep the custom value in the JSON field instead of creating a new field in
the domain class itself.  This avoids double storage.

==== Custom Field Design

Custom fields are used by many different parts of the framework to allow customization
of your application.  The features that are associated with custom fields include:

* <<Configurable Types>>
* <<Flex Types>>
* <<Module Additions>>

These all use the common
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/custom/ExtensibleFieldHelper.html[ExtensibleFieldHelper^]
icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] helper methods to access the field values.
The <<Configurable Types>> and <<Flex Types>> also create helper methods in the domain class
(e.g. `setRmaTypeValue()`).

All of these types of custom fields store the values in the JSON column `fields`
in the domain record.
The FieldExtension (user-defined and additions) are stored with the field name as-is.
The Configurable Types and flex types use a prefix that is the field name for the
configuration field.  For example,  the FlexType field name of 'rmaType' uses the prefix
'rmaType _'.




==== Custom Field Usage

The user can define custom fields on most domain classes that are marked to allow this.  These can
appear in the framework definition tags such as the <<efEdit>> tag.  By default, the custom fields
are not shown in the web pages, but the user can configure the pages to show any of the custom fields.

The custom fields do not appear to be normal fields on the domain class.  They do NOT have a getters
and setters.  Instead, the framework uses the
link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/data/FieldDefinitionInterface.html[FieldDefinitionInterface^]
icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] to access the value in the domain.



===== ExtensibleFieldHolder Annotation

You, as the application developer, must mark your domain classes that you wish to allow custom fields.
A simple domain class might look like this:

[source,groovy]
.Extensible Fields Use
----
@MappedEntity
@DomainEntity
class SampleDomain {
  String key
  String name
  . . .

  @Nullable <.>
  @ExtensibleFieldHolder  <.>
  @MappedProperty(type = DataType.JSON) <.>
  String fields  <.>

}
----
<.> The field should allow no custom fields.
<.> The extensible fields requires a place to store the values (in JSON).
<.> The data type is a native JSON type (jsonb in Postgres).  This allows direct queries on
    the custom values.
<.> The suggested field name is `fields`.  This is a short name for use in complex
    SQL queries on the custom fields.

NOTE: You should not change the column name for custom fields on a production database.
      There is no automatic database migration to handle a column name change.

This will use the field `fields` in the domain class and save it in the database with
an unlimited `jsonb` column.
===== Accessing Custom Field Values

Now that your domain supports custom fields, how do you access them?
The core framework supports setting/displaying the values via the <<Definition Pages>>
and the <<Rest API>>.  The fields are configured using the <<Field Extension GUI>>.

To access the fields in your code, you can use the convenience method for the custom field
as if it was a property.  For example, if you have the custom field 'caseColor' on the
domain, you can access it using this syntax:

[source,groovy]
.Example - Accessing Custom Fields as a Property
----

def order = new Order(order: 'M1002')

order.caseColor = 'Red'   // <.>
def color = order.caseColor = 'Red'   // <.>

----
<.> Set a custom field 'caseColor' to 'Red'.
<.> Gets the custom field 'caseColor' from the order.

Alternately, you can also use the `setFieldValue()` and `getFieldValue()`
methods that are added to your domain classes.  This is used in framework code internally.

[source,groovy]
.Example - Accessing Custom Fields
----

def order = new Order(order: 'M1002')

order.setFieldValue('caseColor', 'Red')   // <.>

Date promiseDate = order.getFieldValue('promiseDate') // <.>

----
<.> Set a custom field 'caseColor' to 'Red'.
<.> The set and get methods support the field extension data types such as Date and other
    supported <<Field Types>>.


===== Deleting Fields

You can delete the field definition.  Existing records will not have the value removed from the
`fields` column, but the the support logic won't process them for display/editing.

Also, the data in the `fields` column will no longer be validated, but it is part of the
stored values.

You can also change the custom field name, but existing values in domain records will not
be changed.

==== Extension Logging

You can enabled several levels of logging for the _org.simplemes.eframe.custom.FieldExtensionHelper_
class to track what field extensions are loaded and how they are performing.  The levels used in the extension process are:

* `Debug` - Lists custom fields added to core objects.
* `Trace` - Logs whenever a value is added/retrieved from the custom field storage.
            Also logs when the child records are stored for custom child lists.


==== Field Extension Example

A simple example domain class may help you understand how these custom features can be used.
In this example, you, as the application developer, provide an _Order_ domain class.
This class represents a customer order:

[source,groovy]
.Example - Extensible Domain
----
public class Order {
  String order             // <.>
  String product
  BigDecimal quantity
     . . .
  @Nullable
  @ExtensibleFieldHolder  <.>
  @MappedProperty(type = DataType.JSON)
  String fields
}
----
<.> The order name, product and quantity ordered.
<.> Defines the column that will hold the JSON values of the custom fields.

The end user of your application wants to add some custom fields to help them process orders more
easily. The fields needed are:

[width=50]
|===
|Field|Format

|`promiseDate`| Date
|`caseColor`|String
|===

In this example, the user added `promiseDate` and `caseColor` fields.

image::guis/customFieldAdd.png[Custom Field Add,align="center",width=60%]

The user can put these fields anywhere on the core _Order_ displays by moving the fields in the
add/remove panel shown below:

image::guis/orderCustom.png[Order Custom,align="center",width="60%"]

See <<Field Types>> for the list of supported field types.


===== Data Type Changes

The setValue() method will enforce the type, but the type can be changed after data is
created. If the defined type changes and there are existing records with the old type, then the
new data type will be used for the getter. When conversion is not possible, then the string value
will be returned.  Data will normally not be lost, but automatic conversion
to the type may not happen.

For example, you store the value 'XYZ' in a String custom field.  If you later change
the field's type to Number, then you will not be able to return a BigDecimal form of the number.
Instead, the string 'XYZ' will be returned to avoid data loss.  This may trigger exceptions in
your code, but the framework will allow this.

NOTE: One exception is _Booleans_.  These will return a boolean object, if the string value starts with
      't' (any case). This can result in loss of data.


If a custom field is no longer defined for the object, you can still get the value.  You can't
set values when the custom field definition for the specific field is deleted.  This `setValue()`
method will trigger an exception.


==== Single Domain Reference

You can add a custom field that is a reference to a single foreign domain record.
The reference is stored in the JSON using the record UUID.

NOTE: The field definition defines a `valueClassName` that is used to find
      the actual record.  It is important that this `valueClassName` not be changed if data
      already exists for it. If changed, then the record will not be found.


==== Custom Child List

A Custom Child List can be defined as a custom data field in a domain object.  This list of
custom children is stored in its own custom domain object (table), not in the normal JSON storage
field. This allows a large number of custom sub-objects to be defined for a core domain object.

How is this implemented?  A custom field `_complexCustomFields` is added to the domain class to store
the transient list of the records.  The actual custom domain objects are saved like any normal
domain class.  Various portions of the framework support these custom lists of objects:

* JSON Parsing and Formatting.
* CRUD actions in the controller base classes
  (e.g. link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/controller/BaseCrudController.html[BaseCrudController^]
  icon:share-square-o[role="link-blue"] )
* The GUI tags <<efDefinitionList>>, <<efShow>> , <<efCreate>> and <<efEdit>>.
* Support for auto save/delete from core domain objects
  (see link:groovydoc/org/simplemes/eframe/custom/EframePersistenceListener.html[EframePersistenceListener^]
  icon:share-square[role="link-blue"]).
* Normal custom `getFieldValue()` and `setFieldValue()` access.  The `getFieldValue()` method will
  perform a load of the values.

This means your core code and custom lists of objects in complex scenarios will work with little or no
coding in your core application.  A common application of this is in <<Module Additions>>.
Sub-modules can add some very complex sub-objects to core domain objects.

For example, a core _Product_ object needs a custom list of components that can be assembled into
the product.

[source,groovy]
.Example - Custom Child List
----
public class Product {
  String product
     . . .
  @Nullable
  @ExtensibleFieldHolder
  @MappedProperty(type = DataType.JSON)
  String fields
}
----

To support this, the _@ExtensibleFieldHolder_ creates a transient Map `_complexCustomFields` to
hold the list from the database.

Then in a module or other extension, you decide you need to add a list of components to the
Product definition:

[source,groovy]
.Example - Custom Child Sub-Object
----
public class Component {
  @ManyToOne
  Product product // <.>
  Long sequence
  BigDecimal qty

  static keys = ['product', 'sequence'] // <.>

}
----
<.> The parent Product reference.  It is a normal ManyToOn reference (much like a foreign
    reference).  It is stored as a UUID in the DB.
<.> Your custom child needs to have some keys defined.  This allows the JSON update capability.

The list will contain a list of Component sub-objects.

To use this custom child list in a domain, you can define it in <<Module Additions>>:

[source,groovy]
.Example - Custom Child Addition
----
  AdditionConfiguration addition = Addition.configure {
    field {
      domain Order
      name 'orderLines'
      label 'Line Items'
      format CustomChildListFieldFormat
      valueClass OrderLine
      fieldOrder {
        name 'orderLines'
        after 'dueDate'
      }
    }
  }
----

This addition will add an inline grid for these child order line items in the standard
Order definition pages.

When testing using GUI/GEB testing, remember to delete your custom child classes first.

==== Custom Child List - Integration/GUI Testing

Testing lists of child records in Integration/GUI tests is a little more complex than we
would like. The simplest approach for most non-GUI testing is to use the @Rollback notation.

For GUI testing and other scenarios, you may need to use explicit transactions in your tests.
For example:

[source,groovy]
.Example - Integration Testing of Custom Child List
----

  def "test additions to Work Service start action - works in integration"() {
    given: "An order to start"
    Order order = null
    Order.withTransaction {        // <.>
      order = new Order(order: 'M001', product: product)
      setFieldValue('components',[new OrderComponent(product: aProdct, qty: 1.0)])  // <.>
      order.save()
      new OrderService().release(new OrderReleaseRequest(order))
    }

  }


----
<.> All database access in the test must be within a transaction.
<.> The custom child list is set using the normal `setFieldValue()` method.
