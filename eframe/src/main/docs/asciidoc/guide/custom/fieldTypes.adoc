=== Field Types

GORM/Hibernate supports a large number of field types (e.g. String, Date, other
domain classes, etc).  The enterprise framework works with a subset of these types to reduce the
boiler-plate code you must write.  Most of the time, these types are used
internally in the framework and you won't need to use them directly.

Each type is represented by a class in the _data.format_ packages and implements the

The enumeration field type above represents an enumeration field in your domain class.
The standard GORM/Hibernate DB value stored is the ID value from the enumeration itself.

The framework and GORM/Hibernate automatically maps these type of fields to the correct database
type.
