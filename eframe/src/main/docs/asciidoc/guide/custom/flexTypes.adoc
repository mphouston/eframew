=== Flex Types

A Flex Type is one implementation of the <<Configurable Types>>.
Flex Types are used to define custom fields needed for specific domain records and
special-purpose POGOs. These allow your users to define a list of data fields to collect for
each object (e.g. Order).  This allows your users to add custom fields in specific scenarios.
Your users can define a different set of custom fields for each record if needed.

For example, your application may support multiple order types such as Production or RMA.
The production orders may require a custom field `promiseDate`.
The RMA order may require different custom data fields such as `receivedDate` and `rmaId`.
Flex types allow you to define this order type and make the data fields dependent on the type.

==== Flex Types vs. Configurable Types

One question that frequently comes up as developer is:

  When do I use Flex Types and when do I use Configurable Types?

You generally use Flex Types when you want your end-user to create and choose the data
fields to be collected in a specific case. For example, you have an RMA scenario. You want the
user to choose the RMA Type and the user can change the data collected for that type.
You don't need to use any logic based on the data.  This is a good fit for
the Flex Types.

You will need too look at the flexibility needed by your customer and decided
which approach is easiest that still meets your customer's needs.  If you just need to
collect and the data and have no logic to operate on the values, then Flex Types might
be the best approach.


The <<Configurable Types>> usually involve more programming to add new fields or types:
The basic limitations/features of each approach is shown below.

<<Encoded Types>> are also a consideration for this discussion. New encoded type values
can be added in <<Module Additions>>.  In terms of flexibility and complexity, they fall
in between the Flex Types and Configurable Types.
