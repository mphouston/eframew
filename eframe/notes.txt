Questions
---------
Need some sort of way to force product for order.  Config by user?
Need way replace dialog contents for Defect Code selection.
No default dashboard found.  Maybe add link on error message to run demoData?
Enum need varying in DB?  All limited length fields need varchar()?  Maybe length too short?
TaskMenu - Refresh with dev mode?
How are keys defined in domains?  fieldOrder then keys.
No fieldOrder, find by key on CRUDRest does a 'find by null()'.
  Keys has field name that does not exist, gives ugly message.
Add Getting Started section to Domains/GUIS/Controllers/Services.
  Template/Getting Started with Domains?
TaskMenu without folder disappears.
GUI with single field.
Add option on get

Custom Field Rework
--------------------
Tasks
=====
  Add API for adding value to fields.  Supports tracking options.
    x Test with tracking and Rest API updates?
    x Update docs for mes-core, assy with API custom examples.
    x Dirty Map ready for saving.
    x FieldHolderMap - put() marks as dirty.  Has Text ready for saving.  Dirty= changedSinceLastJsonSerialize.
      x new method put(name,value,CustomFieldConfig).
  REST API - Disable _config export/import by default.  Some mechanism to enable it on get?
    Add URI with UUID for the get responses? (e.g. _uri: http.../UUID).
    Check on update of fields.  Should add to the list?
    Test update of fields in GUI preserves older custom field values.
  Archive works - full history preserved.
  FieldHolderMap - Prevent storing unsupported types?
  Option to force Flex Type/DE/FE field definitions before collection?

  CustomFieldConfig - interface
    CustomFieldTracking tracking - enum
    format - FieldFormat - null if type can be inferred from JSON (String, Number/DigDecimal, Boolean).
  Fix adocs to match impl: fieldExtension.adoc:184 history/type/config example.
  Add fix for undetected missed update. See  https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-data/issues/299
  Add validation on Custom Field creation that prevents save if the name matches a core field.  Do in FieldExtension?

Domain/POGO:
  Test Scenarios

    Round-trip - Update with value only history.
    Round-trip - Update with value details history.
    Round-trip - With config change (no history to full history).



Data Entry
==========
Always allow data to be logged via API without setup.
Define DE fields to be collected at specific places/events against order/LSN.
  What triggers are needed?  Through events back to dashboard?  Similar to scan events?
Need required field on DEField.
  Required at DE Level too?  Collect at Start/Complete, etc feature?
  Need common field definition handling for FlexField, FieldExtension, DEField.
  Required flag in FlexField, FieldExtension, DEField.
    Enforced at collection.
Trigger collection at:
  Dashboard button press  1.0
  After scan.   Later Release?
  After start/complete. Later Release?
Can disable check to avoid performance hit.
How is collection configured?
  In Dashboard Editor?
  At routing operation?
  Link with dedicated columns or JSON structure.
Flag to trace all values collected (Latest Value Only, All Values, All Data (Who/what/when/where).
Events:
  Pre/Post Start/Complete/Done
  For (Order, Product, Routing/Oper, WorkCenter, WorkType) - Multiples.
Add to Traveller and Order History Reports.
Use Flex Type setup is for prompting?  or Just copy field properties to DEField?
Link To objects (Order, Product, Routing/Oper, WorkCenter, WorkType).  Needs to support future W/I, tools,etc.
  Primary display is for a single link.  Can be switched to list mode if needed.
  Always stored in another table.
    DE
      DEField
      DELink (Order,Product...) as id? or ask key field only?


Tasks
=====
ENH: Look at ArchUnit: https://www.archunit.org/ (uses bytecode).
ISSUE: API: Look at just sending  fields jsonb as sub-JSON instead of naming conventions and special logic.
ISSUE: Support in non-CRUD endpoint with Domain as part of request.
ISSUE: JSON Mapper ignores invalid fields on input (non-CRUD endpoint).
PERF: Child save (DomainEntityHelper.childRecordUpdated() calls) forces parent to search engine.
      Possible performance issue with multiple saves.  Needs some sort of queue with coalescing logic to reduce updates to Search Engine.
ISSUE: Exception in Freemarker always comes back as 400 response.  Need real message and real exception.
ISSUE: $$('defectData').setValue(uuid) - Displays the UUID, not the display value?
ISSUE: Create Flex Type with duplicate FlexType - Error displayed, but not on create screen any more.
ISSUE: Add tk.setComboValue(uuid) for the config type field.  ReadOnly and not readOnly()
ISSUE: Domain Ref as readOnly show the UUID.  Needs to display the short string.
ENH: Auto create order if not exists?  In Jackson, or controller?  Client question?  MDE?  or Flag in client with button to create?
ISSUE: Sort order in findDefects conflict with sorting.  If an order is passed in for filter criteria, then it is overwritten by the sorting 'order=asc' parameter.
ISSUE: <@efField> is still using the controller's model name in textField and similar places.  Needs to detect this case and
       not grab the model from the modelAndView in non-definition GUI scenarios.  Force the user to use the modleName="..." option.


DOC: Search all docs?
DOC: ASCIIDoc TOC on left, collapse all but current. 2.0 HTML generation into separate pages.
     Joint server-side/client side sample.
     Top-Level Guide Entries
       How to Create a new Module.
    Doc answers these questions:
      How to display a dialog?
      How to build a list in a dashboard?
      How to popup dialog to edit/add record?  Pass uuid into server-side
ENH: Icon to clear messages on top.
ISSUE: JS displayDialog button labels as 'Yes' shows as 'Yes.label'.
ISSUE: Release Product with routing and LSNs does not create LSN_OPER_STATE from GUI.
ISSUE: Action Log report not receiving order when run from .jar file.  (Parameter is ordr).
SECURITY: Move all o.s.eframe.test to separate .jar file.  Include test hooks for:
            request user fallback (all fallbacks).

Look at mes-assy Assemble Dialog use of buttons.  The .ftl file does not define the Ok/Cancel button logic.
Look at Large BOM/Defect list affect on basic read/update of Order. Cascade updates.

FileList field format.
  Multiples.
  Generic table of list.
  Abstract storage.
  Archive binary or reference to could location.

Vue vs. Dashboard
-----------------
  https://www.mindk.com/blog/react-vs-vue/
  Dashboard
  ---------
    con - Config nightmare.
    con - setup
    con - developer learning curve
    pro - Very dynamic

  Vue Composition
  ---------------
    pro - Mostly markup and custom components (e.g. LogDefect UI).
    con - npm/Typescript hurdles (one time hit ?)
    con - Static flow in dashboard.
    pro - complex layout/features possible.
      

Buefy - Bad Key tabbing in calendar.
Bootstrap Vue- Ok, but not enough components.  No editable drop-down.
Prime more themes
  Need to include calendar localization data.
Element UI - Looks good, good updates.  https://element.eleme.io/#/en-US/component/menu
Vuetify - Odd keyboard in calendar.  Has summary on frameworks.
Quasar Bad keys for calendar.  Has splitter.


Comparison:
  https://vuetifyjs.com/en/introduction/why-vuetify#comparison-to-other-frameworks

Splitter:
  https://vuejsexamples.com/a-vue-js-simple-and-touch-ready-panes-splitter-resizer/  -- Good.

The big issue is the dynamic needs of a dashboard.  Vue seems to handle this poorly.
You can send dynamic HTML/Vue using the render function of the component definition.
This can retrieve the content and build it each time is is rendered, but it is very cumbersome.  Must
build a virtual DOM for each element.  Probably means parsing HTML in javascript (ugh).
Alternative: Use the template option on the component definition.  This works, but the definition is fixed now.
             We would need pass data values to it somehow.  The normal v-model doesn't seem to work.
Alternative2: Pass down the HTML for the component once, with data elements.  Not sure how
              to get them into the v-model.



Scan Dashboard - Input field for use with phone keyboard.
Traveller report shows M1001 not current order.
Call generateExtensionDoc (e.g. generateExtensionDocAll) in main .gradle and in gradle.yml
Taskmenu refresh logic.
  Part of page?
  Does not see Dashboard records in production when demoData loaded later.  Maybe add TaskMenuHelper.clearCache() to be called from demoData,
         Maybe add timer to TaskMenuHelper caching.
  First time Error:

Groovy extension GUI with hooks?
Ask question updating suggest on Webix forums.
Check out JaCoCo https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/ and gradle plugin.
Figure out automatic shift to upper case on input.  Which fields?  Toggle?
Support JWT as Authorization header with std OAuth access token support.



Globals - Theme?
Fix mess with efForm.dashboard.  Support type='dashboard', 'buttonHolder' and 'dialog'.
Consider moving to use of status UNAUTHORIZED vs. FORBIDDEN.
Issue 672 Still broken.  Update project ref-issue to 2.1.3 and verify that it is still broken.
Add workaround for update failure: 299.  Remove sop.
Version and opt locking (custom JDBCOperations).
Cascading updates.  Find some way to prevent? - isDirty or save() option?
Is Repository findByUuid() and findAll() needed?  Use CrudRepository.findById() and .findAll()?

Support cache in specific use cases:
  UserPreferences - timed, any update for user flushed cache? done in PreferenceHolder?
  FieldExtension/GUI - Already cached at the domainUtils level with FieldGUIExtension via ExtensibleFieldHelper
  Others as needed.

  Support for MPE?
  Check Search in CrudGUITester and add to definition list logic/controller.
  Look into Jackson skipping foreign references.  Only need key and ID fields to import.
  Simplify Client.javascript to one per Controller by default -  Add GUI test of logging level in EFrameJSLoggingGUISpec.
  Add E2E test for optimistic locking detection.  In definition GUIs.
  Reports
    Test in MES app.

  Bugs:
    Definition List boolean checkbox not centered.
    Definition List key field allows HTML un-escaped in it.
    Show Page with name="<script>alert('bad')</script>" fails with Javascript syntax error in SampleParent.
    Edit/Create? page save failures.  Fixing problem and re-saving value gives error (Invalid UUID string: null)
  Look at using https://github.com/apps/whitesource-bolt-for-github for CVE library scanning.
    Others: https://dzone.com/articles/8-free-security-tools-every-developer-should-know
  Reports
    Still an issue?  Can't reproduce in simple query.  Fix issue with date ranges error by TZ offset?

Multi-tenant
------------
Unique DB for each customer running under one server.
Master DB that defines all tenants for a given DB/server cluster.
  Defines connection info for all tenants - encrypted.
  Connection pool created upon startup or on demand with flyway triggered?  Consider Liquibase instead?
  Liquibase - Module support?
    resources/db/mes-assy/V1.0.0.sql
Request always has tenant ID in URL as sub-domain: https://acme.simplemes.org/
Replacement for Micronaut-Data required.
  Provide a connection pool for each tenant.
    Connection pool wrapped with security to limit access to other pools.
    Immutable while request is being processed.
    Use Hikari Pool.
Convert from Netty to Jetty to simplify run-time environment.
Module/addition is on master toggle in JVM. Secondary check on tenant.
  Dynamic execution based on tenant.
  Custom fields defined in DB.  Re-loaded for each tenant.  Cached distributed cache.
Need isolated archive storage by tenant.
Need JWT to encode tenant in JWT/Refresh tokens?
Create new tenant with single push button:
  Creates new DB in server.
  Sets up sub-domain.
  Support move of tenant: DB move with some config move.  May be slow.

Main Tasks - Multi-tenancy
--------------------------
Replace MN Data - Use JTA and HikariCP
Convert to Jetty
Archive Storage
Sub-domain support.

  mkdir eframe.git
  cd eframe.git
  git init --bare
MN Create
   cd smes
   mn create-app eframe -l groovy -f spock,hibernate-gorm,management
IDEA
  New Project from Existing Sources (default for all)
  Import Gradle.
  Remove second-level eframe module in IDEA.
  Edit build.gradle (import sources).
  Move Application.groovy to correct package.
GIT Setup
  cd eframe
  git init
  git remote add origin mphouston@s:/opt/git/smes/eframe.git
  git clone ssh://mphouston@s:/opt/git/smes/eframe.git
  Added master section to .git/config


Make Module for Distr.
=====================
Delete from .jar
  Application.class
  logback.xml

UI
==
UI Toolkit Module (two flavors: JQX and HTML).


Notes on Micronaut investigation


Key Missing Features
====================

Persistence - CRUD and ad-hoc
  Txn
  Foreign Keys
Message Broker (with Saga/undo support)
Custom Fields
Client Asset delivery/gzip/etc
UI Layer - tags?
Modules (e.g. plugins)

Key Decisions
=============
Persistence
UI
Single mini-service or multiple?  UI inside service?
Graal is not supported with Hibernate now.   Ignore Graal for now.

Modules
=======
eframe (library) only
  org.simplemes.eframe.*
  /opt/git/mmes/eframe.git
mes-core
mes-assy
mes (appl)

Module JAR Support
==================
compile "org.simplemes:eframe"
Provides:
  Controllers
  Views
  Security Providers
  Domains
Dependencies:
  compile "io.micronaut:micronaut-security-jwt"



Package structure
=================
Option 1 org.simplemes.eframe
  application  (startup and common pages "/")
    controller
    domain
    service
  auth
    controller
    domain
  controller
  custom
    controller
    domain
  domain
  auth
    controller
    domain
  misc
  system
  test
  web
    request
    view
    builder
    widget


std layout
----------
  XYZ
    controller
    domain
    service
    page (GEB in test module)

views structure
===============
views
  auth/loginAuth, denied
  home/index
  includes
    header.hbs
src/assets
  css
  javascript
  images


Groovy vs. Kotlin
=================

Groovy is clearer.
GORM vs. JPA vs. Kotlin Expose



UI Decision
===========
JQX or Other Toolkit?
Toolkit Module?
Webix Notes:
  Look at https://snippet.webix.com/309867f6 for replacing sections of a page (e.g. dashboard) and form layout
  Look at https://snippet.webix.com/5e25f570 for form layout.
  https://snippet.webix.com/a674ca30 - Simulate a real login form.
  Input fields have unique ID generated.  Not easy to test.  $('#field') vs. $('div', view_id: 'field').find('input').  Module?
    Uses in Page: field { module(new InputFieldModule(id: 'field')) }
  Forms can't be submitted like normal.  Need JS code.
  Consider white-listing function calls in dynamic pages?

Webix Dashboard Activity Example
================================
     dash.y = function() {
       console.log("y()")
     };
     _json = {
       view: "button", value: "List", type: "form", click: "dash.y();", width: tk.width('33%')
     };

Page Mockups
============
  static content = {
    startButton {module(new ButtonModule(id: 'start'))}  //{ $('div', view_id: 'start').find('button')}
    panelA { $('div', view_id: 'PanelA')}
    panelB { $('div', view_id: 'PanelB')}
    resizer { $('div', view_id: 'resizerA')}
    //startButton { $('div', view_id: 'start')}  // Works
    //startButton { $('button')}  // adding view_id takes extra 32ms to find element.
  }
